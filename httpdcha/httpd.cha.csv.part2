Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests with configurations which match those of the initial request.  Revert to the original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests with URIs different from the initial request) if any access control hooks or providers are not registered as permitting this optimization. Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration which can accept additional mode and flag data. The configuration walk optimizations were originally proposed a while ago (see http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=116536713506234&w=2); they have been used since then in production systems and appear to be stable and effective.  They permit certain combinations of modules and clients to function efficiently, especially when a deeply recursive series of internal requests, such as those generated by certain WebDAV directives. The major change from the original proposal is a cleaner mechanism for detecting modules which may expect the old behaviour.  This has been tested successfully with Subversion's mod_authz_svn, which specifically against its own private access control configuration files. 	requires

Change 'init' function to take the context pointer as an input parameter, and reorder to be first. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache.c (ssl_scache_init): Adjust accordingly. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache_memcache.c (struct context): Add servers field.

Add context pointer as first arg for the other function types. (SSLModConfigRec): Remove tSessionCacheData* fields; add sesscache_context field. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache.c (ssl_scache_init): Move once-per-process invocation check back into here. (ssl_scache_*): Adjust to use context pointer. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache_shmcb.c, modules/ssl/ssl_scache_dc.c, modules/ssl/ssl_scache_dbm.c: Adjust all implementations to use opaque context pointer. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache_memcache.c: Move memcache context into the context structure rather than using global state. * modules/ssl/ssl_engine_config.c: Remove handling of pSessionCacheData* fields in SSLModConfigRec. 	r630323

Replace all the ssl_scache_* prototypes with provider vtable objects. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache.c (ssl_scache_init, ssl_scache_kill, ssl_scache_retrieve, ssl_scache_store, ssl_scache_remove, ssl_ext_status_hook): Use callbacks from vtable rather than ifdef spaghetti. * modules/ssl/ssl_engine_init.c (ssl_init_ctx_session_cache): Only install the OpenSSL callbacks if a vtable is configured. * modules/ssl/ssl_engine_config.c (ssl_cmd_SSLSessionCache): Set up vtable pointer. * modules/ssl/ssl_scache_dc.c, modules/ssl_scache_mc.c: Adjust to make implementations static, and add vtable definition. * modules/ssl_scache_shmcb.c: Likewise; also move the init one-per-process requirement down here. * modules/ssl_scache_dbm.c: Likewise; also (temporarily) use a local subpool in the store callback. 	r630163

Introduce configuration groups to allow inheritance by virtual hosts of database configurations from the main server.  The post_config hook function determines the minimal set of distinct configurations necessary so that database connection pools are shared between virtual hosts whenever possible. The SQL statements which should be prepared for each database connection are now stored in a hash for each virtual host during the configuration phase, and these hashes are merged in the normal manner using apr_hash_overlay() with that of the main server.  This allows for statements to be de-registered by DBDPrepareSQL, if desired.  The post_config hook function then compares the statements registered for each virtual host when determining if a separate configuration group is required.  The changes in r424798, r432560, r432562, and r466641, which still have problems with configuration inheritance, are therefore no longer necessary. 	r503931

"Introduce a check_config phase between pre_config and open_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged to the console. The open_logs phase is already used somewhat for this purpose by certain MPMs (winnt, prefork, worker, and event) but only by forcing their functions ahead of the core ap_open_logs() function, and since this phase runs after the ap_signal_server function during startup, it can not be used to generate messages on the console when restarting. Add the check_config phase to mod_info and mod_example. Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase and format messages for both the console and the error log, as appropriate.  Bounds and sanity checks on the values of the MPM directives are handled in sequence in this phase instead of in the various directive handling functions, since those functions (e.g., set_max_clients()) may not be called at all if their directives do not appear in the configuration files, and even if they are called, there is no guarantee that this will occur in any particular order. Remove from the worker and event MPMs the code in the pre_config phase that alters the configuration node tree by re-ordering ThreadsPerChild ahead of MaxClients.  This code is effective but insufficient; for example, if ServerLimit follows MaxClients, the test against server_limit in set_max_clients() is invalid.  (In practice, this only results in incorrect or absent warnings on the console, because server_limit is set to its configured value when the main loop re-runs the configuration process.) Prevent ap_threads_per_child from exceeding thread_limit in the winnt, worker, and event MPMs.  This situation could occur if ThreadsPerChild was not specified in the configuration files and ThreadLimit was set to a value smaller than DEFAULT_THREADS_PER_CHILD, because set_threads_per_child() would never be called and therefore its bounds check against thread_limit would not be performed. Remove from the winnt, prefork, worker, and event MPMs the changed_limit_at_restart flag.  Set the first_server_limit and first_thread_limit values during the first execution of the check_config function, and use them to detect changes to ServerLimit and ThreadLimit across restarts and issue appropriately formatted warnings.  Remove the comments about the error log being a ""bit bucket""; this was true when the code was originally committed in r92530 but that was due to a bug fixed in r92769. Be consistent about setting all MPM configuration directive values in the pre_config phase. Rephrase and reformat the console and log file messages relating to MPM configuration directives to be consistent across all MPMs.  Use briefer messages when logging to the error log than to the console. Update miscellaneous stale comments and messages (e.g., reference to daemons_min_free in worker and event MPMs, ""prefork open_logs"" in winnt MPM, and StartServers in netware MPM). The winnt, netware, beos, and mpmt_os2 MPMs should be tested by developers with access to those platforms, especially the winnt MPM, which has unique logic with respect to distinguishing between parent and child processes during the configuration phases. Update the English documentation for the worker MPM's ThreadsPerChild directive, which no longer needs to precede other MPM directives in the configuration files if it has a non-default value.  The German (.de) and Japanese (.ja) translations should be updated by developers fluent in those languages. "	r431460

Authz refactoring Merge from branches/authz-dev Basically here is a list of what has been done: - Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to provider based - Remove the ap_requires field from the core_dir_config structure - Remove the function ap_requires() since its functionality is no longer supported or necessary in the refactoring - Remove the calls to ap_some_auth_required() in the core request handling to allow the  hooks to be called in all cases. - Add the new module mod_authz_core which will act as the authorization provider vector and contain common authz directives such as 'Require', 'Reject' and  '<RequireAlias>' - Add the new module mod_authn_core which will contain common authentication directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName' and '<AuthnProviderAlias>' - Move the check for METHOD_MASK out of the authz providers and into the authz_core provider vector - Define the status codes that can be returned by the authz providers as AUTHZ_DENIED,  AUTHZ_GRANTED and AUTHZ_GENERAL_ERROR - Remove the 'Satisfy' directive - Implement the '<RequireAll>', '<RequireOne>' block directives  to handle the 'and' and 'or' logic for authorization. - Remove the 'AuthzXXXAuthoritative' directives from all of the authz providers - Implement the 'Reject' directive that will deny authorization if the argument is true - Fold the 'Reject' directive into the '<RequireAll>', '<RequireOne>' logic - Reimplement the host based authorization functionality provided by 'allow', 'deny' and 'order' as authz providers - Remove the 'allow', 'deny' and 'order' directives - Merge mod_authn_alias into mod_authn_core - Add '<RequireAlias>' functionality which is similar to '<AuthnProviderAlias>' but specific to authorization aliasing - Remove all of the references to the 'authzxxxAuthoritative' directives from the documentation - Remove the 'Satisfy' directive from the documentation - Remove 'Allow', 'Deny', 'Order' directives from the documentation - Document '<RequireAll>', '<RequireOne>', 'Reject' directives - Reimplement the APIs ap_auth_type(), ap_auth_name() as optional functions and move the  actual implementation into mod_authn_core - Reimplement the API ap_some_auth_required() as an optional function and move the  actual implementation into mod_authz_core Major Changes: - Added the directives <RequireAll>, <RequireOne>, <RequireAlias>, Reject - Expanded the functionality of the directive 'Require' to handle all authorization and access control - Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle host-based access control - Removed the directives 'Allow', 'Deny', 'Order', 'Satisfy', 'AuthzXXXAuthoritative' - Removed the ap_require() API - Moved the directives 'AuthType', 'AuthName' out of mod_core and into mod_authn_core - Moved the directive 'Require' out of mod_core and into mod_authz_core - Merged mod_authn_alias into mod_authn_core - Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and 'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group' Benefits: - All authorization and access control is now handle through two directives, 'Require' and 'Reject' - Authorization has been expanded to allow for complex 'AND/OR' control logic through the directives '<RequireAll>' and '<RequireOne>' - Configuration is now much simpler and consistent across the board - Other modules like mod_ssl and mod_proxy should be able to plug into and take advantage of  the same provider based authorization mechanism by implementing their own providers Issues: - Backwards compatibility between 2.2 and 2.3 configurations will be broken in the area  of authorization and access control due to the fact that the directives 'allow', 'deny',  'order' and 'satisfy' have been changed to 'Require all granted', 'Require all denied' or some variation of the authz host-based providers. - Existing third party authorization modules will have to adapt to the new structure. 	removed.

* Fix PR38017 by handling the selection of the hostname in the same way for non proxied and reverse proxied requests. We need to handle both cases in the same manner as for the reverse proxy case we have the following situation: If a cached entry is looked up by mod_cache's quick handler r->proxyreq is still unset in the reverse proxy case as it only gets set in the translate name hook (either by ProxyPass or mod_rewrite) which is run after the quick handler hook. This is different to the forward proxy case where it gets set before the quick handler is run (in the post_read_request hook). If a cache entry is created by the CACHE_SAVE filter we always have r->proxyreq set correctly. So we must ensure that in the reverse proxy case we use the same code path and using the canonical name seems to be the right thing to do in the reverse proxy case. 	r367798

----------------------------
NET_TIME, as a standalone feature, was a horrid idea. The core filter will NOT operate correctly across platforms (even between Linux/Solaris) without setting up the conn->timeout, so always apply the timeout when establishing the core filter. The keep-alive-timeout is entirely an HTTP-ism, and needs to move to the http protocol handler.  Note #1; this isn't triggered in the event mpm, but the event mpm introspects s->keep_alive_timeout directly adding it to the pollset, so this is a non-sequitor. Finally, once the headers are read, the named virtual host may have a different (more/less permissive) timeout for the remainder of the request body.  This http-centric patch picks up that subtle detail and can switch to a named-vhost timeout. 	r306495

Fix PR36410; Change how the get_suexec_identity hook is handled by CGID. Instead of using mod_userdir and mod_suexec specific hacks, we now run the hook on the httpd side of the handler.

This ensures that cgid's doer runs before any other We use cgid's request config to store the ugid. If ugid == empty_ugid, we DON'T call ap_os_create_privileged_process, because our doer would return the magic empty_ugid constant. Having the doer return NULL is no good, because then userdir and mod_suexec's doers would be called. Instead, we call plain old apr_proc_create(). 	registered

The old welcome page is a constant source of confusion to random web surfers who stumble on unconfigured apache installs. 2. New users, when finding on a docroot with dozens of files, are often confused about where to put their own content. 3. The international welcome page is a large source of bug reports from people wanting to tweak grammar or provide new translations. 4.

"*** Patch for EBCDIC-host and HTTP/0.9 responses only *** In dealing with a HTTP/0.9 response to a proxy request, we have pre-read data that is not an HTTP header. At this point of processing, we don't know yet whether the data is going to be interpreted an binary or not. (In fact, we may never find out because HTTP/0.9 lacks the Content-Type headers; only by configuring mod_charset_lite can we control the conversion). But mod_charset_lite will get control only later, so it cannot decide on the conversion of the current buffer full of data. => This is an extreme and rare situation normally. So, for catching the most obvious problem (talking not to a HTTP server but to some other protocol), the best guess here is to treat the buffer as ""text/*"" (to make error messages readable).

However, it also makes it easier to serve files anywhere on disk by mistake, and makes other URI-handling bugs more severe than they would be otherwise.

Fix a problem whereby multiple MMapFile directives would cause a segfault on startup. mod_file_cache keeps a hash table in the cmd->pool and puts an entry in that hash table for each of its files and mmaps, all of which are opened into cmd->pool.

So it was deleting mmaps that were already cleaned up and closing files that were already cleaned up in all cases.  This has never been valid... amazed it ever worked.

The old mechanism would jam a handler name in whenever DAV was configured for a directory. i.e. there weren't really any tests other than ""is DAV handling this directory?""

This is now possible since all handlers are called (before, you *had* to set your own name so that your handler would be called). Since the test is actually quite straightforward, we actually gain overall: no more fixups hook, and a couple integer comparisons (rather than a string compare). And hoo... the code is simpler, too.

After an install, the default config files are useful.  After an upgrade they aren't. If the config directive's syntax changed, Apache will tell you which one changed, and the docs are a better place to go for details then the default config files.  BTW, the syntax of a directive hasn't changed for a VERY long time. If the semantics changed, then nobody will ever know that they need to look in the default config files to determine that they semantics changed, because there is no error message. The argument that you want to be able to get the defaults back doesn't hold water, because 99.9% of all admins backup their files before modifying them.  If you aren't backing them up, then that is your problem. The argument that you may not have a full config directory also doesn't hold water, because the assumption is that the conf/ directory is coming from a working server. 	r96157

Fix the case where if there is no ErrorDocument specified for an error, the error would be sent to the client *twice* because both the filter and the core would trigger error responses. The problem is that the filters have already handled some errors (say 413) and due to the ap_get_client_block API, the error was morphed into 400. Therefore, ap_discard_request_body must use brigades directly rather than the ap_get_client_block API so that any potential errors are not dropped. The special value AP_FILTER_ERROR indicates that the lower level has already dealt with this problem (ap_die() will realize this).  Otherwise, we'll error with HTTP_BAD_REQUEST and ap_die() will take it from there. This also prevents needless memory copies when we are just going to discard it anyway. Thanks to Cliff Woolley who found this wacky problem. 	r95424

Thanks Ryan for cleaning up after my laziness.  :)  Here are just a few last little changes.  ->datafile should be initialized... but doing so brings up the fact that the check in run_rewritemap_programs() was expecting ->datafile to have a string attached to it.  For clarity, let's just use argv[0] there.  And since we've reinstated the use of ->checkfile, we no longer need that extra apr_stat() I hacked in, so let's get rid of it. 	r95375
----------------------------
Tokenize the arguments for rewrite programs during config parsing, and just use that information later.  I was having a problem with prg directives with arguments failing the configuration.

This gets the test suite working for me again. 	r95372

We can't just apr_stat in the first init round because we haven't run apr_tokenize_to_argv() yet, and it would be a relatively ugly hack to run it twice just for that.  Well, I suppose we could store the argv in the opposed to the old exit(1) method) if we go to execute a rewritemap and discover it doesn't exist, and log a nice descriptive message at the end of the error_log. 	rewritemap

Although it appears reasonable to immediately gather the Error log and level from the config; these are per-vhost entities that can't be processed as we preload the config tree.

Remove SSLLog and SSLLogLevel directives in favor of having mod_ssl use the standard ErrorLog directives. 	r95129
----------------------------
Change mod_ssl from using ssl_log() to ap_log_error(). The issue is that ssl_log doesn't handle apr_status_t result codes.  This leads to a number of places (esp. with mutexes) where the error codes get lost.  Rather than extending ssl_log further, since mod_ssl is part of our core, migrate to ap_log_error.  This means that mod_ssl no longer does its own logging. Most uses of SSL_ADD_ERRNO are now mapped correctly to apr_status_t values (mainly because the APIs that used to return errnos are now APRized and have apr_status_t codes available). SSL_LOG_TRACE and SSL_LOG_DEBUG were mapped to the APLOG_DEBUG values. mod_ssl prints out a LOT of debugging information, so mod_ssl with LogLevel Debug may not be a good idea - perhaps mod_ssl should be less chatty. Numerous printf type collisions were also resolved. (The ssl logging code itself will be removed in a subsequent commit.) This has been discussed on dev@httpd, but the fact that there isn't much to review besides the mindless changes, I'm going to commit now and rely on CTR if I screwed up anything on the translation. 	r95127

Part 3 of the ISAPI overhaul.  Reframe the 'server conf' into 'dir conf' options, creating one single cache of loaded modules [heck, that's what it was before.]  This allows finer grained control of specific modules that must be 'configured' around to deal with their peculiarities.

First pass at trying to standardize httpd-2.0's usage of APR and APR-util so that they can be separated - use an installed APR and APR-util with httpd-2.0.  This is not expected to achieve full separation, but is merely the first step in the process.  The tree should still be buildable in the source-only case. This commit does the following things: - Use the standard find_apr.m4 and find_apu.m4 m4 macro files that flood and Subversion already use for locating APR and APR-util.  This adds the --with-apr and --with-apr-util configure options. - Stop using APRVARS and export_vars.sh. - Use apr-config and apu-config to determine dependencies. - Add AP_BUILD_SRCLIB_DIRS and AP_CLEAN_SRCLIB_DIRS values (names stink) to dynamically figure out what subdirs in srclib we will build.

Fix subreqs with non-defined Content-Types being served improperly. If we do not know a C-T for a subreq, we *must* propogate that non-knowledge upwards to the main request. Previously, if you used a DirectoryIndex with a file without a C-T (say .shtml without AddType), the r->content_type will be kept as httpd/unix-directory when we promoted the subreq in mod_dir.  Since there would be no handler on this file, ap_invoke_handler (config.c:355) would set the handler to be httpd/unix-directory (which was the old C-T of the dir).  This would then trigger the handler to become httpd/unix-directory. mod_autoindex would then try to serve the request.  But, the filename was propogated upwards by mod_dir's DirectoryIndex via internal_fast_redirect - it would then return a 403 trying to generate a mod_autoindex page for a file. Now, we will use ap_default_type() which is correct. 	r94676
