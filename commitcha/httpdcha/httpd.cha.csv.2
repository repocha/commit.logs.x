*) Fix a bug where we keep files open until the end of a keepalive connection, which can result in: (24)Too many open files: file permissions deny server access especially on threaded servers.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) The value emitted by ServerSignature now mimics the Server HTTP header as controlled by ServerTokens.  [Francis Daly <deva daoine.org>]	
----------------------------
*) Terminate CGI scripts when the client connection drops.  This fix only applies to some normal paths in mod_cgi.  mod_cgid is still busted.  PR 8388  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix a bug where 416 ""Range not satisfiable"" was being returned for content that should have been redirected. [Greg Ames]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix streaming output from an nph- CGI script.  CGI:IRC now works.  PR 8482  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Change the CacheRoot processing to check for a required value at config time. This saves a lot of wasted processing if the mod_disk_cache module is loaded but no CacheRoot was provided. This fix also adds code to log an error and avoid useless pallocs and procesing when the computed cache file name cannot be opened. This also updates the docs accordingly.  [Paul J. Reder]	
----------------------------
*) Introduce the EnableSendfile directive, allowing users of NFS shares to disable sendfile mechanics when they either fail outright or provide intermitantly corrupted data.  PR [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
"*) Resolve the error ""An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket.  : winnt_accept: AcceptEx failed. Attempting to recover."" for users of various firewall and anti-virus software on Windows.  PR 8325  [William Rowe]"

"*) Add the ProxyBadHeader directive, which gives the admin some control on how mod_proxy should handle bogus HTTP headers from proxied servers. This allows 2.0 to ""emulate"" 1.3's behavior if desired. [Jim Jagielski]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix a problem with streaming script output and mod_cgid. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: CVE-2002-0840 (cve.mitre.org) HTML-escape the address produced by ap_server_signature() against this cross-site scripting vulnerability exposed by the directive 'UseCanonicalName Off'.  Also HTML-escape the SERVER_NAME environment variable for CGI and SSI requests.  It's safe to escape as only the '<', '>', and '&' characters are affected, which won't appear in a valid hostname.  Reported by Matthew Murphy <mattmurphy kc.rr.com>.  [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a core dump in mod_cache when it attemtped to store uncopyable buckets. This happened, for instance, when a file to be cached contained SSI tags to execute a CGI script (passed as a pipe bucket). [Paul J. Reder]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a mutex problem in mod_ssl session cache support which could lead to an infinite loop.  PR 12705 [Amund Elstad <amund.elstad ergo.no>, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Allow the UserDir directive to accept a list of directories. This matches what Apache 1.3 does.  Also add documentation for this feature. [Jay Ball <jay veggiespam.com>]	
----------------------------
*) SuExec needs to use the same default directory as the rest of server, namely /usr/local/apache2. [SangBeom han <sbhan os.korea.ac.kr>]	
----------------------------
*) The protocol version (eg: HTTP/1.1) in the request line parsing is now case insensitive. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Allow AddOutputFilterByType to add multiple filters per directive. [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Add support for using fnmatch patterns in the final path segment of an Include statement (eg.. include /foo/bar/*.conf). and remove the noise on stderr during config dir processing. [Joe Orton <jorton redhat.com>]

----------------------------
*) Win32: Implement ThreadLimit directive in the Windows MPM. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Remove CacheOn config directive since it is set but never checked. No sense wasting cycles on unused code. Besides, the only truly bug free code is deleted code. :)   [Paul J. Reder]	
----------------------------
*) BufferLogs are now run-time enabled, and the log_config now has 2 new callbacks to allow a 3rd party module to actually do the writing of the log file [Ian Holsman]

----------------------------
*) Fixed mod_rewrite's RewriteMap prg: support so that request/response pairs will no longer get out of sync with each other.  PR 9534 [Cliff Woolley]	
----------------------------
*) Performance improvement for keepalive requests: when setting aside a small file for potential concatenation with the next response on the connection, set aside the file descriptor rather than copying the file into the heap.  [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) Modified version check on openssl so that it finds the executable first and then performs a check of the version, only warning the user if they chose, or we selected, an old version of OpenSSL. This change also allows the code to work for non-openssl libraries selected via the --with-ssl=dir option, which can override the automated library check in any case.  [Roy Fielding] Changes with Apache 2.0.40

----------------------------
*) When deciding on the default address family for listening sockets, make sure we can actually bind to an AF_INET6 socket before deciding that we should default to AF_INET6.  This fixes a startup problem on certain levels of OpenUNIX.  PR 10235.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Changes to the internationalized error documents: Comment them out in the default config file to make the default install as simple as possible; Correct the english 500 error to be more understandable; Add a Swedish translation. [Thomas Sjogren <thomas northernsecurity.net>, Erik Abele <erik codefaktor.de>, Rich Bowen, Joshua Slive]	
----------------------------
*) Increase the limit on file descriptors per process in apachectl. [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) Add a new directive: MaxMemFree.  MaxMemFree makes it possible to configure the maximum amount of memory the allocators will hold on to for reuse.  Anything over the MaxMemFree threshold will be free()d.  This directive is useful when uncommon large peaks occur in memory usage.  It should _not_ be used to mask defective modules' memory use.  [Sander Striker]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the Content-Length filter so that HTTP/1.0 requests to CGI scripts would not result in a truncated response. [Ryan Bloom, Justin Erenkrantz, Cliff Woolley]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a long-standing bug in 2.0, CGI scripts were being called with relative paths instead of absolute paths.  Apache 1.3 used absolute paths for everything except for SuExec, this brings back that standard.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix infinite loop due to two HTTP_IN filters being present for internally redirected requests.  PR 10146.  [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Switch conn_rec->keepalive to an enumeration rather than a bitfield. [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Support WinNT CGI invocation through ScriptInterpreterSource 'registry' for script interpreter paths and names with non-ascii characters in the executable filepath.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) mod_rewrite can now set cookies  (RewriteRule (.*) - [CO=name:$1:.domain]) [Brian Degenhardt <bmd mp3.com>, Ian Holsman]	
----------------------------
*) We must set the MIME-type for .shtml files to text/html if we want them to be parsed for SSI tags.  Add the config for that to the default config file so that it is easier to enable .shtml parsing. [Dave Dyer <ddyer real-me.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Make the default_handler catch all requests that aren't served by another handler.  This also gets us to return a 404 if a directory is requested, there is no DirectoryIndex, and mod_autoindex isn't loaded.  [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Allow 'make install DESTDIR=/path'.  This allows packagers to install into a directory different from the one that was configured.  This also mirrors the root= feature from 1.3.  We cannot use prefix=, because both APR and APR-util resolve their installation paths at configuration time.  This means that there is no variable prefix to replace.  [Andreas Hasenack <andreas netbank.com.br>]	
----------------------------
*) AIX 4.3.2 and above: Define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT. These levels of AIX don't have a thundering herd problem with accept().  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) prefork MPM: Ignore mutex errors during graceful restart.  For certain types of mutexes (particularly SysV semaphores), we should expect to occasionally fail to obtain or release the mutex during restart processing.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Fix install-bindist.sh so that it finds any perl instead of just early perl 5.x versions.  This is consistent with a build/install from source, and it allows the perl scripts installed by a bindist to work on systems with perl 5.6.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Allow CGI scripts to return their Content-Length.  This also fixes a hang on HEAD requests seen on certain platforms (such as FreeBSD). [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) allow POST method over SSL when per-directory client cert authentication is used with 'SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate' enabled and a client cert was found in the ssl session cache.	
----------------------------
"*) 'SSLOptions +OptRengotiate' will use client cert in from the ssl session cache when there is no cert chain in the cache.  prior to the fix this situation would result in a FORBIDDEN response and error message ""Cannot find peer certificate chain"" [Doug MacEachern]"

*) Fix AcceptPathInfo. PR 8234  [Cliff Woolley]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: CVE-2002-1592 (cve.mitre.org) [CERT VU#165803] Added the APLOG_TOCLIENT flag to ap_log_rerror() to explicitly tell the server that warning messages should be sent to the client in addition to being recorded in the error log. Prior to this change, ap_log_rerror() always sent warning messages to the client. In one case, a faulty CGI script caused the server to send a warning message to the client that contained the full path to the CGI script. This could be considered a minor security exposure. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Moved the call to apr_mmap_dup outside the error branch so that it would actually get called. This fixes a core dump at init everytime you use the MMapFile directive. PR 8314 [Paul J. Reder]	
----------------------------
*) Trigger an error when a LoadModule directive attempts to load a module which is built-in.  This is a common error when switching from a DSO build to a static build.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Allow VPATH builds to succeed when configured from an empty directory.  [Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>]

----------------------------
*) Added support for Posix semaphore mutex locking (AcceptMutex posixsem) for those platforms that support it. If using the default implementation, this is between pthread and sysvsem in priority. This implies it's the new default for Darwin. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) worker MPM: Don't create a listener thread until we have a worker thread.  Otherwise, in situations where we'll have to wait a while to take over scoreboard slots from a previous generation, we'll be accepting connections we can't process yet.  [Jeff Trawick]

----------------------------
*) Modify receive/send loop in proxy_http and proxy_ftp so that should it be necessary, the remote server socket is closed before transmitting the last buffer (set by ProxyIOBufferSize) to the client. This prevents the backend server from being forced to hang around while the last few bytes are transmitted to a slow client. Fix the case where no error checking was performed on the final brigade in the loop. [Graham Leggett]

*) Implement new ScoreBoardFile directive logic. This affects how we create the scoreboard's shared memory segment. If the directive is present, a name-based segment is created. If the directive is not present, first an anonymous segment is created, and if that fails, a name-based segment is created from a file of the name DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD. This gives third-party applications the ability to access our scoreboard.  [Aaron Bannert]	
----------------------------
*) Fix ap_directory_merge() to correctly merge configs when there is no <Directory /> block.  [Justin Erenkrantz, William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Performance: Reuse per-connection transaction pools in the worker MPM, rather than destroying and recreating them.  [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) mod_negotiation: ForceLanguagePriority now uses 'Prefer' as the default if the directive is not specified.  This mirrors older behavior without changes to the httpd.conf.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Allow statically linked support binaries with the new --enable-static-support flag, and enable this behavior in the binbuild script. Also add a new --enable-static-htdbm flag.  [Aaron Bannert]	
----------------------------
*) Be a bit more sane with regard to CanonicalNames.  If the user has specified they want to use the CanonicalName, but they have not configured a port with the ServerName, then use the same port that the original request used. [Ryan Bloom and Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) suexec: Allow HTTPS and SSL_* environment variables to be passed through to CGI scripts. PR 9163 [Brian Reid <breid customlogic.com>, Zvi Har'El <rl math.technion.ac.il>]	
----------------------------
"*) apxs: LTFLAGS envvar can override default libtool options.  Try ""LTFLAGS=' ' apxs -c mod_foo.c"" to see what libtool does under the covers.  [Jeff Trawick]"	
----------------------------
*) The Location: response header field, used for external redirect, *must* be an absoluteURI.  The Redirect directive tested for that, but RedirectMatch didn't -- it would allow almost anything through.  Now it will try to turn an abs_path into an absoluteURI, but it will correctly varf like Redirect if the final redirection target isn't an absoluteURI.  [Ken Coar] Changes with Apache 2.0.31	
----------------------------
*) Add a timeout option to the proxy code 'ProxyTimeout' [Ian Holsman]	
----------------------------
*) FTP directory listings are now always retrieved in ASCII mode. The FTP proxy properly escapes URI's and HTML in the generated listing, and escapes the path components when talking to the FTP server. It is now possible to browse the root directory by using a url like:   ftp://user@host/%2f/ (ported from apache_1.3.24) Also, the last path component may contain wildcard characters '*' and '?', and if they do, a directory listing is created instead of a file retrieval. Example: ftp://user@host/httpd/server/*.c [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Added single-listener unserialized accept support to the worker MPM [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) New Directive for mod_proxy: 'ProxyPreserveHost'. This passes the incoming host header through to the proxied server [Geoff <g.russell ieee.org>]	
----------------------------
*) New Directive Option for ProxyPass. It now can block a location from being proxied [Jukka Pihl <jukka.pihl entirem.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Change the pre_config hook to return a value. Modules can now emit an error message and then cause the server to quit gracefully during startup. This required a bump to the MMN.  [Aaron Bannert]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix some unix socket descriptor leaks in the handler side of mod_cgid (the part that runs in the server process).  Whack a silly ""close(-1)"" in the handler too.  [Jeff Trawick]"	
----------------------------
*) Fixed PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING from mod_negotiation results. Resolves the common case of using negotation to resolve the request /script/foo for /script.cgi/foo.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Do not install unnecessary pcre headers like config.h and internal.h. [Joe Orton <joe manyfish.co.uk>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a problem in the parsing of the <Proxy foo> directive. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Clear the output socket descriptor in unixd_accept() to make sure we don't supply a bogus socket to the caller if the accept fails. This caused problems with the worker MPM, which tried to process the returned socket if it was non-NULL.  [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) Add FileETag directive to allow configurable control of what data are used to form ETag values for file-based URIs.  MMN bumped to 20020111 because of fields added to the end of the core_dir_config structure.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a segfault in mod_rewrite's logging code caused by passing the wrong config to ap_get_remote_host().  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed a segfault that happened during graceful shutdown (or when the httpd ran out of file descriptors) with the worker MPM [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) Split all Win32 modules [excluding the core components mod_core, mod_so, mod_win32 and the winnt mpm] into individual loadable modules, so the administrator may individually disable the former compiled-in modules by simply commenting out their LoadModule directives.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) mod_ssl adjustments to help with using toolkits other than OpenSSL: Use SSL functions/macros instead of directly dereferencing SSL structures wherever possible. Add type-casts for the cases where functions return a generic pointer. Add $SSL/include to configure search path. [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix SSLPassPhraseDialog exec: and SSLRandomSeed exec: [Doug MacEachern] Changes with Apache 2.0.30	
----------------------------
*) Fix a typo in mod_deflate's m4 config section. [albert chin <china thewrittenword.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix the module identifer as shown in the docs for various core modules (e.g., the identifer for mod_log_config was previously listed as config_log_module).  PR #9338 [James Watson <ap2bug sowega.org>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix LimitRequestBody directive by placing it in the HTTP filter.  [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Introduced the ForceLanguagePriority directive, to prevent returning MULTIPLE_CHOICES or NONE_ACCEPTABLE in some cases, when using Multiviews.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a problem which prevented mod_cgid and suexec from working together reliably [Greg Ames]	
----------------------------
*) Remove the call to exit() from within mod_auth_digest's post_config phase.  [Aaron Bannert]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Fix bug that could cause CGI scripts with QUERY_STRINGS to fail. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Move any load library path environment variables out of apachectl and into a separate environment variable file which can be more easily tailored by the admin.  The environment variable file as built by Apache may have additional system- specific settings.  For example, on OS/390 we tailor the heap settings to allow lots of threads.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
"*) The POD no longer assumes the child is listening on 127.0.0.1 and now pulls the first hostname in the list of listeners to perform the dummy connect on. This fixes a bug when the user had configured the Listen directive for an IP other than 127.0.0.1. This would result in undead children and error messages such as ""Connection refused: connect to listener"". [Aaron Bannert]"	
----------------------------
*) Change make install and apxs -i processing of DSO modules to perform special handling on platforms where libtool doesn't install mod_foo.so.  This fixes some wonkiness on HP-UX, Tru64, and AIX which prevented standard LoadModule statements from working. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Allow apxs to be used to build DSOs on AIX without requiring the user to hard-code the list of import files.  (This should help on OS/390 and BeOS as well.)  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Resolved segfault in mod_isapi when configuring with ISAPICacheFile. PR 8563, 8919  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
"*) Add back in the ""suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /path/to/suexec)"" message that we had back in apache-1.3 and still have scattered throughout our docs.  [Aaron Bannert]"	
----------------------------
*) Change post_config hook to return a value, allowing you to flag a error post config [Ian Holsman, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Allow SUEXEC_BIN (the path to the suexec binary that is hard-coded into the server) to be specified to the configure script by the --with-suexec-bin parameter.  [Aaron Bannert]	
----------------------------
*) Bail out at configure time if an invalid MPM was specified. [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere fujitsu-siemens.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Prevent segv in ap_note_basic_auth_failure() when no AuthName is configured [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the behavior of the XBitHack directive. [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>, Cliff Woolley] PR#8804	
----------------------------
*) Fix a file descriptor leak in mod_include.  When we include a file, we use a sub-request, but we didn't destroy the sub-request immediately, instead we waited until the original request was done.  This patch closes the sub-request as soon as the data is done being generated.  [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Allow modules that add sockets to the ap_listeners list to define the function that should be used to accept on that socket.  Each MPM can define their own function to use for the accept function with the MPM_ACCEPT_FUNC macro.  This also abstracts out all of the Unix accept error handling logic, which has become out of synch across Unix MPMs. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a bug which would cause the response headers to be omitted when sending a negotiated ErrorDocument because the required filters were attached to the wrong request_rec. [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Add 'redirect-carefully' environment option to disable sending redirects under special circumstances.  This is helpful for Microsoft's WebFolders when accessing a directory resource via DAV methods.  [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Really reset the MaxClients value in worker and threaded when the configured value is not a multiple of the number of threads per child.  We said we did previously but we forgot to. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) If shared modules are requested and mod_so is not available, produce a fatal config-time error.  [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
"*) When no port is given in a ""ServerName host"" directive, the server_rec->port is now set to zero, not 80. That allows for run-time deduction of the correct server port (depending on SSL/plain, and depending also on the current setting of UseCanonicalName). This change makes redirections work, even with https:// connections. As in Apache-1.3, the connection's actual port number is never used, only the ServerName setting or the client's Host: setting. Documentation updated to reflect the change. [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Introduce htdbm, a user management utility for db/dbm authorization databases.  [Mladen Turk <mturk mappingsoft.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Introduce an Apache mod_ssl initial configuration template (ssl.conf, generated from ssl-std.conf).  [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Add the support/checkgid helper app, which checks the run-time validity of group identifiers usable in the Group directive. [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
"*) Various --enable-so options have been fixed: --enable-so is treated as ""static""; explicit --enable-so=shared issues an error; and explicit --enable-so fails with error on systems without APR_HAS_DSO.  [Aaron Bannert]"	
----------------------------
"*) Fix some bungling of the remote port in rfc1413.c so that IdentityCheck retrieves the proper user id instead of failing and thus always returning ""nobody."" [Dick Streefland <Dick.Streefland xs4all.nl>]"	
----------------------------
*) Simplified mod_env's directives to behave as most directives are expected, in that UnsetEnv will not unset a SetEnv and PassEnv directive following that UnsetEnv within the same container. Also provides a runtime startup warning if a PassEnv configured environment value is undefined.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) The worker MPM is now completely ported to APR's new lock API. It uses native APR types for thread mutexes, cross-process mutexes, and condition variables.  [Aaron Bannert]	
----------------------------
*) Exit when we can't listen on any of the configured ports.  This is the same behavior as 1.3, and it avoids having the MPMs to deal with bogus ap_listen_rec structures.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Introduce the MultiviewsMatch directive, to allow the operator to be flexible in recognizing Handlers and Filters filename extensions as part of the Multiviews matching logic, strict with MultiviewsMatch NegotiatedOnly to accept only filename extentions that designate negotiated parameters, (content type, charset, etc.) or MultiviewsAll for the 1.3 behavior of matching any files, even if they have unregistered extensions.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the configure script to add a LoadModule directive to the default httpd.conf for any module that was compiled as a DSO.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]	
----------------------------
*) prefork: Don't segfault when we are able to listen on some but not all of the configured ports.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Introduce ap_directory_walk rewrite (with further optimizations required) to adapt to the ap_process_request_internal() changes. Optimized so subrequests and redirects now reuse previous section merges, until we mismatch with the original directory_walk, and precomputed r->finfo results will cause directory_walk to skip the most expensive phases of the function.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Remove the Port directive.  In it's place, the Listen directive is now a required directive, which tells Apache what port to listen on.  The ServerName directive has also been extended to accept an optional port.  If the port is specified to the ServerName, the server will report that port whenever it reports the port that it is listening on.  This change was made to ease configuration errors that stem from having a Port directive, and a Listen directive.  In that situation, the server would only listen to the port specified by the Listen command, which caused a lot of confusion to users.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Added mod_mime_magic, mod_unique_id and mod_vhost_alias to the Win32 build, as loadable modules.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Allow configure help strings to work with autoconf 2.50+ and 2.13. [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Some style changes to the code that does ProxyErrorOverride. Fixed config merge behaviour. [Graham Leggett]	
----------------------------
*) Switch proc_pthread AcceptMutex configuration directive to pthread to be consistent with 1.3.  [Justin Erenkrantz]	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the worker MPM.  We no longer re-use transaction pools.  This incurs less overhead than shuffling the pools around so that they can be re-used.  Remove one of the queue's condition variables.  We just redefined the API to state that you can't try to add more stuff than you allocated segments for.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]	
----------------------------
*) Remove the Win32 script-processing exception from mod_cgi, and roll build_command_line/build_argv_list into a unified, overrideable ap_cgi_build_command optional function.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix a seg fault in mod_include.  When we are generating an internal redirect, we must set r->uri to """", not a bogus string, and not NULL.  [Ryan Bloom]"	
----------------------------
*) Optimized location_walk, so subrequests, redirects and second passes now reuse previous section merges on a <Location > by <Location > basis, until we mismatch with the original location_walk. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Back out the 1.45 change to util_script.c.  This change made us set the environment variable REQUEST_URI to the redirected URI, instead of the originally requested URI. [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>]	
----------------------------
*) Normalize the primary request, redirects and sub-requests to run the same ap_process_request_internal for consistency in robustness, behavior and security.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Some initial support for the cygwin platform [prefork only]. This is not to be confused with support for the WinNT/Win32 platform, which is the recommended configuration for native Win32 users.  The cygwin platform support is recommended for cygwin platform users. [Stipe Tolj <tolj wapme-systems.de>]	
----------------------------
*) Changed syntax of Set{Input|Output}Filter.  The list of filters must be semicolon delimited (if more than one filter is given.) The Set{Input|Output}Filter directive now overrides a parent container's directive (e.g. SetInputFilter in <Directory /web/foo> will override any SetInputFilter directive in <Directory /web>.) This new syntax is more consistent with Add{Input|Output}Filter directives defined in mod_mime.  Also cures a bug in prior releases where the Set{Input|Output}Filter directive would corrupt the global configuration if the multiple directives were nested. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Cured what's ailed mime for quite some time.  If an AddSomething was given in the configuration (Language, Charset, Handler or Encoding) Apache would set the content type as given by AddType, but refused to check the mime.types file if AddType wasn't given for that specific extension.  Setting the AddHandler for .html without setting the AddType text/html html would cause Apache to use the default content type.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
"*) Move the installed /manual directory out of the /htdocs/ tree, so that it can be kept more independently from the remaining document root. The ""Alias /manual ..."" already allowed for easy projection into existing private document trees. [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
"*) Add specified user attributes to the environment when using mod_auth_ldap. This allows you to use mod_include to embed specified user attributes in a page like so: Hello <!--#echo var=""AUTHENTICATE_CN""-->, how are you? [Graham Leggett]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix a performance problem with the worker MPM.  We now create transaction pools once, and re-use them for each connection. [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]	
----------------------------
*) Modfied mod_mime to prevent mod_negotation from serving a multiview of a 'handler' or 'filter', so that any filename extension that does not contribute to the negotiated metadata can't be served without an explicit request.  E.g., if the .Z extension is associated with an unzip filter, the user request somefile.Z.html, mod_negotiation won't serve it.  It can serve somefile.Z.html when somefile.Z is requested, since the .Z extension is explictly requested, if the .html extension is associated with ContentType text/html. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Introduce the AddInputFilter filter[;filter...] ext [ext...] and corresponding AddOutputFilter syntax, to insert one or more filters by mod_mime filename extension processing. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a growing connection pool in core_output_filter() for keepalive requests.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Clean up location_walk, so that this step performs a minimum amount of redundant effort (it must be run twice, but it will no longer reparse all <Location > blocks when the request uri hadn't changed.)  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Eliminate proxy: (and all other 'special') processing from the ap_directory_walk() phase.  Modules that want to use special walk logic should refer to the mod_proxy map_to_location example, with it's proxy_walk and proxysection implementation.  This makes either directory_walk flavor much more legible, since that phase only runs against real <Directory > blocks. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Introduce the map_to_storage hook, which allows modules to bypass the directory_walk and file_walk for non-file requests.  TRACE shortcut moved to http_protocol.c as APR_HOOK_MIDDLE, and the directory_walk/file_walk happen as APR_HOOK_VERY_LAST in core.c. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Add the ability for mod_include to add the INCLUDES filter if the file is configured for the server-parsed handler. This makes the configuration for .shtml files much easier to understand, and allows mod_include to honor Apache 1.3 config files.   Based on Doug MacEachern's patch to PHP to do the same thing.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) force OpenSSL to ignore process local-caching and to always get/set/delete sessions using mod_ssl's callbacks [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>, Geoff Thorpe <geoff geoffthorpe.net>]	
----------------------------
*) fix segv in mod_mime if no AddTypes are configured [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Changed the late-1.3 log_config substitution %c to %X, to log the status of the closed connection, as it conflicts with the far more common, historical ssl logging directive %...{var}c.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Added a default commented-out mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap configuration to httpd-std.conf and httpd-win.conf [Graham Leggett]	
----------------------------
*) Fix an assertion failure in mod_ssl when the keepalive timeout is reached.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Numerous improvements to the Win32 build system.  Introduced command line builds without requiring .mak files for MSVC 6.0 and later versions. Improved .dsp file compatibility for both Visual Studio 5.0 and 6.0 users. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Rounded out the mod_mime Add/Remove pairs by adding RemoveLanguage and RemoveCharset directives.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) The Unix MPMs other than perchild now allow child server processes to use the accept mutex when starting as root and using SysV sems for the accept mutex.  Previously, this combination would lead to fatal errors in the child server processes.  perchild can't use SysV sems because of security issues.  [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]	
----------------------------
*) We have always used the obsolete/deprecated Netscape syntax for our tracking cookies; now the CookieStyle directive allows the Webmaster to choose the Netscape, RFC2109, or RFC2965 format.  The new CookieDomain directive allows the setting of the cookie's Domain= attribute, too.  PR #s 5006, 5023, 5920, 6140 [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Begin to sanitize the MPM configuration directives.  Now, all MPMs use the same functions for all common MPM directives.  This should make it easier to catch all bugs in these directives once. [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Close a major resource leak.  Every time we had issued a graceful restart, we leaked a socket descriptor. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a bug in mod_expires.  Previous to this patch, if you told mod_expires to add 604800 seconds to the last-modified time, it actually added 604800 usec's to the last-modified time, so that when looking at the response it looked like nothing had been done.  The root of the problem was that we always compute time in usec's, but we ask users to input sec's.  This means we need to convert to usec's before using those values. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) All mod_autoindex query parsing is now quietly quashed with the IndexOption IgnoreClient.  The IndexOption SuppressColumnSorting still drops the column sort <a href>'s for the column headers, but IgnoreClient is required to ignore these Query options entirely. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Introduced new mod_autoindex IndexOptions flags: SuppressIcon to drop the icon column, SuppressRules to drop the <hr> elements, and HTMLTable to create rudimentary HTML table listings (implies FancyIndexing).  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Re-introduced the mod_autoindex IndexOptions flag TrackModified from Apache 1.3.15.  This is needed for two reasons, first, given multiple machines within a server farm, ETags and Last-Modified stamps won't correspond from machine to machine, and second, many Unixes don't capture changes to the date or time stamp of existing files, since these don't modify the dirent itself.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Re-introduced the mod_autoindex IndexOptions flag FoldersFirst and DirectoryWidth options from Apache 1.3.10. [William Rowe, Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Eliminated FancyIndexing directive, deprecated early in Apache 1.3 by the IndexOptions FancyIndexing syntax.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) mod_autoindex now excludes any file names that would result in an error, other than a success or redirect.  Also optimized the parent directory, always included except in the URI '/'. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Eliminate mod_cgi's handling of .exe files without the .exe file extension.  This is already handled by multiviews, if the admin wishes to AddHandler .exe or define a content type handler and associate .exe files with that content type.  Multiviews must be enabled to allow these to be served.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Add a handler to mod_includes.c.  This handler is designed to implement the XbitHack directive.  This can't be done with a fixup, because we need to check the content-type, which is only available in the handler phase.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Add the ability to extend the methods that Apache understands and have those methods <limit>able in the httpd.conf. It uses the same bit mask/shifted offset as the original HTTP methods such as M_GET or M_POST, but expands the total bits from an int to an ap_int64_t to handle more bits for new request methods than an int provides.  [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Add a single listener/multiple worker MPM.  This MPM is definately not fully correct, but it allows us to solve many of the problems that exist in the threaded MPM.  This is a modified version of the threaded MPM.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Apache/Win32 now fills in the service description with Apache's server version string, including loaded and advertised modules. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Improved support for the Win32 build, to recover gracefully from missing apr or apr-util directories or the awk interpreter, create the proper cgi-bin examples, including a test-cgi.bat, and fix the perl shebang line for printenv.pl, when installing from the build environment.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Use new APR number conversion functions to reduce CPU consumption when setting the content length, and in mod_log_config. [Brian Pane]	
----------------------------
*) Fix seg faults in mod_status with ExtendedStatus enabled, after restarts.  A garbage pointer to a vhost's server_rec from the previous generation was being left around under certain conditions. [Greg Ames]	
----------------------------
*) Improve the exports generating awk script.  In the past, we had work around problems in the awk script by avoiding some #if and #ifdefs.  This has bitten us many times in generating the exports.c file.  This improvement allows corrects the header file parsing. [Sander Striker <striker apache.org>] Changes with Apache 2.0.21	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Prevent listening sockets from being inherited by the Apache child process, CGI scripts, rotatelog process etc.  If the Apache child process segfaults, any processes that the child started are not reaped. Prior to this fix, these processes inherited the listening sockets which sometimes prevented the restarted Apache child process from accepting connections (ie, the server would hang). [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Provide vhost and request strings when ExtendedStatus is on. [Greg Ames]	
----------------------------
*) Fix some issues with the pod and prefork: check the pod *after* processing a connection so that a server processing a time- consuming request bails out as soon as practical; when the parent process wakes up a server process via connect(), use an APR timeout on the connect() so that we don't hang for a long time if there aren't server processes around to do accept(). [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]	
----------------------------
*) apxs no longer generates ap_send_http_header() in the example handler	
----------------------------
*) Fix brokenness when ThreadsPerChild is higher than the built-in limit.  We left ap_threads_per_child at the higher value which led to segfaults when doing certain scoreboard operations. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
"*) Extend mod_setenvif to support specifying regular expressions on the SetEnvIf (and SetEnvIfNoCase) directive attribute field. Example:  SetEnvIf ^TS*  [a-z].* HAVE_TS will cause HAVE_TS to be set if any of the request headers begins with ""TS"" and has a value that begins with any character in the set [a-z]. [Bill Stoddard]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix htdigest. It would go into a loop in getline when adding a second user. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Win32 platforms now fully support mod_userdir options.  [Will Rowe]	
----------------------------
"*) Extend mod_headers to support conditional driven Header add, append and set. Use SetEnvIf to set an envar and conditionally add/append/set headers based on this envar thusly: SetEnvIf TSMyHeader value HAVE_TSMyHeader Header add MyHeader ""%t %D"" env=HAVE_TSMyHeader If the request contains header ""TSMyHeader: value"" then header MyHeader: ""t=xxxxxxxxxx D=yyyy"" will be sent on the response. [Bill Stoddard]"	
----------------------------
"*) Extend mod_headers to support using format specifiers on Header add, append and set header values. Two format specifiers are supported: %t - reports, in UTC microseconds since the epoch, when the request was received. %D - reports the time, in microseconds, between when the request was received and the response sent. Examples: Header add MyHeader ""This request served in %D microseconds. %t"" results in a header being added to the response that looks like this: MyHeader: This request served in D=5438 microseconds. t=991424704447256 [Bill Stoddard]"	
----------------------------
*) Optimise reset_filter() in http_protocol.c. [Greg Stein]	
----------------------------
*) Reimplement mod_headers as an output filter. mod_headers can now add custom headers to inbound requests using the RequestHeader directive and to responses using the same old Header directive.  [Graham Leggett] Changes with Apache 2.0.18	
----------------------------
*) Fix processing of the TRACE method.  Previously we passed bogus parms to form_header_field() and it overlaid some vhost structures, resulting in a segfault in check_hostalias(). [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Do not start piped log processes during the config file preflight.  This change also circumvents a problem on Windows where the rotatelog processes created during preflight was not getting cleaned up properly. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix httpd's definition of LTFLAGS to be consistent with that of apr and apr-util, allow it to be overridden by the configure command-line (default=""--silent"") and introduce LT_LDFLAGS to replace what we were formerly abusing as LTFLAGS.  [Roy Fielding]"	
----------------------------
*) Simplify the configure process by moving all libtool stuff to APR and moving hints.m4 inline.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
"*) mod_log_config: %c connection status incorrectly logged as ""-"" (non-keepalive) when MaxKeepAliveRequests is set to 0. [Bill Stoddard]"	
----------------------------
*) Completely revamp configure so that it preserves the standard make variables CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS by moving the configure additions to EXTRA_* variables.  Also, allow the user to specify NOTEST_* values for all of the above, which eliminates the need for THREAD_CPPFLAGS, THREAD_CFLAGS, and OPTIM.  Fix the setting of INCLUDES and EXTRA_INCLUDES.  Check flags as they are added to avoid pointless duplications.  Fix the order in which flags are given on the compile and link lines.  Remove obsolete macros APR_DOEXTRA, AC_ADD_LIBRARY, AC_CHECK_DEFINE, APACHE_PASSTHRU, and APACHE_ONCE. Added APR_SAVE_THE_ENVIRONMENT and APR_RESTORE_THE_ENVIRONMENT macros. Renamed AC_TYPE_RLIM_T macro to APACHE_TYPE_RLIM_T.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Patch prefork to put enough of the signal processing back in so that signals are all handled properly now. The previous patch fixed the deadlock race condition, but broke the user directed signal handling. This fixes it to work the way it did before my previous prefork patch (primarily, SIGTERM is now working).	
----------------------------
*) Fix seg fault at start-up introduced by Ryan's change to enable modules to specify their own logging tags. mod_log_config registers an optional function, ap_register_log_handler(). ap_register_log_handler() was being called by http_core before the directive hash table was created. This patch creates the directive hash table before ap_register_log_handler() is registered as an optional function. [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere fujitsu-siemens.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Allow modules to specify their own logging tags.  This basically allows a module to tell mod_log_config that when %x is encountered a specific function should be called.  Currently, x can be any single character.  It may be more useful to make this a string at some point. [Ryan Bloom] Changes with Apache 2.0.17	
----------------------------
*) Add more options to the ap_mpm_query function.  This also allows MPMs to report if their threads are dynamic or static.  Finally, this also implements a new API, ap_show_mpm, which returns the MPM that was required into the core. [Harrie Hazewinkel <harrie covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Remove BindAddress from the default config file. [<giles nemeton.com.au>]	
----------------------------
*) Allow module authors to add a module to their Apache build using --with-module, without re-running buildconf.  The syntax is: --with-module=module_type:/path/to/module.c The configure script will copy the module.c file to modules/module_type, and it will be added to the relevant Makefiles. currently, this only works for static modules.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
"*) Change the default installation directory to /usr/local/apache2, as now defined by the ""Apache"" layout in config.layout. [Marc Slemko]"	
----------------------------
"*) Fix segfaults for configuration file syntax errors such as ""<Directory>"" followed by ""</Directory"" and ""<Directory>"" followed by ""</Directoryz>"".  [Jeff Trawick]"	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the --enable-layout option of configure.  This makes us use a consistent location for the config.layout file, and it makes configure more portable. [jun-ichiro hagino <itojun iijlab.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Move ap_set_last_modified to the core.  This is a potentially controversial change, because this is kind of HTTP specific.  However many protocols should be able to take advantage of this kind of information.  I expect that headers will need one more layer of indirection for multi-protocol work, but this is a small step in the right direction.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Add a ScriptSock directive to the default config file.  This is only enabled when mod_cgid is used. [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>] Changes with Apache 2.0.15	
----------------------------
*) Untangled the buildconf script and eliminated the need for build's aclocal.m4, generated_lists, build.mk, build2.mk, and a host of other libtool muck that is now under srclib/apr/build.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: Fix a major security problem with double-reverse lookup checking.  Previously, a client connecting over IPv4 would not be matched properly when the server had an IPv6 listening socket. PR #7407   [Taketo Kabe <kiabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>]	
----------------------------
*) Change the way the beos MPM handles polling to allow it to stop and restart.  Problem was the sockets being polled were being reset by the select call, so once it had accepted a connection it was no longer listening on the UDP socket we use for shutdown instructions. APR needs to be altered, patch on it's way. [David Reid]	
----------------------------
*) Get rid of an inadvertent close of file descriptor 2 in mod_mime_magic.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Add a hook, create_request.  This hook allows modules to modify a request while it is being created.  This hook is called for all request_rec's, main request, sub request, and internal redirect. When this hook is called, the r->main, r->prev, r->next pointers have been set, so modules can determine what kind of request this is.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the build process a bit more.  The Apache configure script no longer creates its own helper scripts, it just uses APR's. [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere fujitsu-siemens.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Avoid using sscanf to determine the HTTP protocol number in the common case because sscanf is a performance hog. From Mike Abbot's Accelerating Apache patch number 6. [Mike Abbot <mja trudge.engr.sgi.com>, Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: Fix a security exposure in mod_access.  Previously when IPv6 listening sockets were used, allow/deny-from-IPv4-address rules were not evaluated properly (PR #7407).  Also, add the ability to specify IPv6 address strings with optional prefix length on Allow and Deny.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
"*) Reimplement the Windows MPM (mpm_winnt.c) to eliminate calling DuplicateHandle on an IOCompletionPort (a practice which MS ""discourages""). The new model does not rely on associating the completion port with the listening sockets, thus the completion port can be completely managed within the child process.  A dedicated thread accepts connections off the network, then calls PostQueuedCompletionStatus() to wake up worker threads blocked on the completion port. [Bill Stoddard]"	
----------------------------
*) Bring forward the --suexec-umask option which allows the builder to preset the umask for suexec processes.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Add a -V flag to suexec, which causes it to display the compile-time settings with which it was built.  (Only usable by root or the AP_HTTPD_USER username.)  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fix content-length computation.  We ONLY compute a content-length if We are not in a 1.1 request and we cannot chunk, and this is a keepalive or we already have all the data.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Report unbounded containers in the config file.  Previously, a typo in the </container> directive could result in the rest of the config file being silently ignored, with undesired defaults used. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Move more code from the http module into the core server.  This is core code, basically the default handler, the default input and output filters, and all of the core configuration directives. All of this code is required in order for the server to work, with or without HTTP.  The server is closer to working without the HTTP module, although there is still more to do.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix mod_info, so that <Directory> and <Location> directives are not displayed twice when displaying the current configuration. [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Add config directives to override DEFAULT_ERROR_MSG and DEFAULT_TIME_FORMAT.  This was sent in as PR 6193. [Dan Rench <drench xnet.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Begin to move protocol independant functions out of mod_http.  The goal is to have only functions that are HTTP specific in the http directory. [Ryan Bloom] Changes with Apache 2.0.13	
----------------------------
*) Move the error_bucket definition from the http module to the core server.  Every protocol will need this ability, not just HTTP.  [Ryan Bloom] Changes with Apache 2.0.12	
----------------------------
*) Fix a seg fault in mod_userdir.c.  We used to use the pw structure without ever filling it out.  This fixes PR 7271. [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp> and Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley yahoo.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Make mod_dir use a fixup for sending a redirect to the browser. Before this, we were using a handler, which doesn't make much sense, because the handler wasn't generating any data, it would either return a redirect error code, or DECLINED.  This fits the current hooks better.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Rename the module structures so that the exported symbol matches the file name, and it is easier to automate the installation process (generating LoadModule directives from the module filenames). [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Don't disable threads just because we are using the prefork MPM. If somebody wants to compile without threads, they must now add --disable-threads to the configure command line.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the mod_tls configure process.  This should remove any need to hand-edit any files.  We require OpenSSL 0.9.6 or later, but configure doesn't check that yet.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Add new LogFormat directive, %D, to log time it takes to serve a request in microseconds. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Change AddInputFilter and AddOutputFilter to SetInputFilter and SetOutputFilter.  This corresponds nicely with the other Set directives, which operate on containers while the Add* directives tend to work directly on extensions.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix the AliasMatch directive in Apache 2.0.  When we brought a patch forward from 1.3 to 2.0, we missed a single line, which broke regex aliases.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) We have a poor abstraction in the protocol.  This is a temporary hack to fix the bug, but it will need to be fixed for real.  If we find an error while sending out a custom error response, we back up to the first non-OK request and send the data.  Then, when we send the EOS from finalize_request_protocol, we go to the last request, to ensure that we aren't sending an EOS to a request that has already received one.  Because the data is sent on a different request than the EOS, the error text never gets sent down the filter stack.  This fixes the problem by finding the last request, and sending the data with that request.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Get the correct IP address if ServerName isn't set and we can't find a fully-qualified domain name at startup. PR#7170 [Danek Duvall <dduvall eng.sun.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Make mod_cgid work with SuExec.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Adopt apr user/group name features for mod_rewrite.  Eliminates some 'extra' stat's for user/group since they should never occur, and now resolves the SCRIPT_USER and SCRIPT_GROUP, including on WinNT NTFS volumes.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
"*) Adopt apr features to simplify mod_includes.  This changes the behavior of the USER_NAME variable, unknown uid's are now reported as USER_NAME=""<unknown>"" rather than the old user#000 result. WinNT now resolves USER_NAME on NTFS volumes.  [William Rowe]"	
----------------------------
*) Adopt apr features for simplifing mod_userdir, and accept the new Win32/OS2 exceptions without hiccuping.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Replace configure --with-optim option by using and saving the environment variable OPTIM instead.  This is needed because configure options do not support multiple flags separated by spaces. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Modify the apr_stat/lstat/getfileinfo calls within apache to use the most optimal APR_FINFO_wanted bits.  This spares Win32 from performing very expensive owner, group and permission lookups and allows the server to function until these apr_finfo_t fields are implemented under Win32.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Support for typedsafe optional functions - that is functions exported by optional modules, which, therefore, may or may not be present, depending on configuration. See the experimental modules mod_optional_fn_{ex,im}port for sample code. [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) When SuExec is specified, we need to add it to the list of targets to be built.  If we don't, then any changes to the configuration won't affect SuExec, unless 'make suexec' is specifically run.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Correct a bug in determining when we follow symlinks.  The code expected a stat -1 result, not an apr_status_t positive error. Also check if the APR_FINFO_USER fields are valid before we follow the link.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Move initgroupgs, ap_uname2id and ap_gname2id from util.c to mpm_common.c.  These functions are only valid on some platforms, so they should not be in the main-line code. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Stop checking to see if this is a pipelined request if we know for a fact that it isn't.  Basically, if r->connection->keepalive == 0. This keeps us from making an extra read call when serving a 1.0 request.  [Ryan Bloom and Greg Stein]	
----------------------------
*) Fix the handling of variable expansion look-ahead in mod_rewrite, i.e. syntax like %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER}, and also fix the parsing of more complicated nested RewriteMap lookups. PR#7087 [Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
"*) Some adjustment on the handling and automatic setting (via hints.m4) of various compilation flags (eg: CFLAGS). Also, add the capability to specify flags (NOTEST_CFLAGS and NOTEST_LDFLAGS) which are used to compile Apache, but not used during the configuration process. Useful for flags like ""-Werror"". [Jim Jagielski]"	
----------------------------
*) EBCDIC: Fix some missing ASCII conversion on some protocol data. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Use a real pool to dup the error log descriptor.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Ignore \r\n or \n when using PEEK mode for input filters.  The problem is that some browsers send extra lines at the end of POST requests, and we don't want to delay sending data back to the user just because the browser isn't well behaved. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Get SuEXEC working again.  We can't send absolute paths to suExec because it refuses to execute those programs.  SuEXEC also wasn't always recognizing configuration changes made using the autoconf setup.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Allow the buildconf process to find the config.m4 files in the correct order.  Basically, we can now name config.m4 files as config\d\d.m4, and we will sort them correctly when inserting them into the build process.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Get mod_cgid to use apr calls for creating the actual CGI process. This also allows mod_cgid to use ap_os_create_priviledged_process, thus allowing for SuExec execution from mod_cgid.  Currently, we do not support everything that standard SuExec supports, but at least it works minimally now. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Allow SuExec to be configured from the ./configure command line. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
"*) Apache is now IPv6-capable.  On systems where APR supports IPv6, Apache gets IPv6 listening sockets by default.  Additionally, the Listen, NameVirtualHost, and <VirtualHost> directives support IPv6 numeric address strings (e.g., ""Listen [fe80::1]:8080""). [Jeff Trawick]"	
----------------------------
*) Modify the install directory layout.  Modules are now installed in modules/.  Shared libraries should be installed in libraries/, but we don't have any of those on Unix yet.  All install directories are modifyable at configure time. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Get the functions in server/linked into the server, regardless of which modules linked into the server.  This uses the same hack for Apache that we use for APR and apr-util to ensure all of the necessary functions are linked.  As a part of thise, the CHARSET_EBCDIC was renamed to AP_CHARSET_EBCDIC for namespace protection, and to make the scripts a bit easier. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Rework the RFC1413 handling to make it thread-safe, use a timeout on the query, and remove IPv4 dependencies.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
"*) Get ""NameVirtualHost *"" working in 2.0.  [Ryan Bloom]"	
----------------------------
*) Get mod_cgid and mod_rewrite to work as DSOs by changing the way they keep track of whether or not their  post config hook has been called before.  Instead of a static variable (which is replaced when the DSO is loaded a second time), use userdata in the process pool. [Jeff Trawick] Changes with Apache 2.0a9	
----------------------------
*) Win32 now requires perl to complete the final install step for users to build + install on Win32.  Makefile.win now rewrites @@ServerRoot@ and installs the conf, htdocs and htdocs/manual directories. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the export list a bit.  This creates a single unified list of functions exported by APR.  The export list is generated at configure time, and that list is then used to generate the exports.c file. Because of the way the export list is generated, we only export those functions that are valid on the platform we are building on. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Enable logging the cookie with mod_log_config [Sander van Zoest <sander covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a segfault in mod_info when it reaches the end of the configuration. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) APR: Add new apr_getopt_long function to handle long options. [B. W. Fitzpatrick <fitz red-bean.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Make cgi-bin work as a regular directory when using mod_vhost_alias with no VirtualScriptAlias directives. PR#6829 [Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) Mod_info.c has now been ported to Apache 2.0.  As a part of this change, the root of the configuration tree has been exposed to modules as ap_conftree. [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Get SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT working again.  This uses the hints file to determine which platforms define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Destroy the pthread mutex in lock_intra_cleanup() for PR#6824. [Shuichi Kitaguchi <ki hh.iij4u.or.jp>]	
----------------------------
*) Always compute the content length, whether it is sent or not. The reason for this, is that it allows us to correctly report the bytes_sent when logging the request.  This also simplifies content-length filter a bit, and fixes the actual byte-reporing code in mod_log_config.c [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Port three log methods from mod_log_config 1.3 to 2.0: CLF compliant '-' byte count, method and protocol. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Add a new LogFormat directive, %c, that will log connection status at the end of the response as follows: 'X' - connection aborted before the response completed. '+' - connection may be kept-alive by the server. '-' - connection will be closed by the server. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Most Apache functions work on EBCDIC machines again, as protocol data is now translated (again).  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Add suexec support back.  [Manoj Kasichainula]	
----------------------------
*) Namespace protect some macros declared in ap_config.h [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) APR pipes on Unix and Win32 are now cleaned up automatically when the associated pool goes away.  (APR pipes on OS/2 were already had this logic.)  This resolvs a fatal file descriptor leak with CGIs. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) The final line of the config file was not being read if there was no \n at the end of it.  This was caused by apr_fgets returning APR_EOF even though we had read valid data.  This is solved by making cfg_getline check the buff that was returned from apr_fgets. If apr_fgets return APR_EOF, but there was data in the buf, then we return the buf, otherwise we return NULL. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: Tighten up the syntax checking of Host: headers to fix a security bug in some mass virtual hosting configurations that can allow a remote attacker to retrieve some files on the system that should be inaccessible. [Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) Add support for /, //, //servername and //server/sharename parsing of <Directory> blocks under Win32 and OS2. [Tim Costello, William Rowe, Brian Harvard]	
----------------------------
*) Fix mod_log_config so that it compiles cleanly with BUFFERED_LOGS [Mike Abbott <mja sgi.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Install apachectl correctly, and substitute the proper values so that it works again.  [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Bring forward from 1.3.13 the config directory implementation [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
"*) Multiple build and configuration fixes Build process: -add datadir and localstatedir substitutions -fix layout name -fix logfilename misspelling -fix evaluation of installation dir variables and -replace $foobar by $(foobar) to be usefull in the makefile Cross compile: -add rules for cross-compiling in rules.mk. Okay, rule to check for $CC_FOR_BUILD is still missing -use CHECK_TOOL instead of CHECK_PROG for ranlib -add missing ""AR=@AR@"" to severaly Makefile.in's -cache result for ""struct rlimit"" -compile all helper programs with native and cross compiler and use the native version to generate header file [Rüdiger Kuhlmann <Tadu gmx.de>]"	
----------------------------
*) Add .dll caching directive ISAPICacheFile to mod_isapi. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Expand dbmmanage to allow -d -m -s -p options for Crypt, MD5, SHA1 and plaintext password encodings.  Make feature tests a bit more flexible.  [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: CVE-2000-0913 (cve.mitre.org) Fix a security problem that affects certain configurations of mod_rewrite. If the result of a RewriteRule is a filename that contains expansion specifiers, especially regexp backreferences $0..$9 and %0..%9, then it may be possible for an attacker to access any file on the web server. [Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) Overhaul of dbmmanage to allow a groups arg (as in Apache 1.2) as well as a comment arg to the add, adduser and update cmds. update allows the user to clear or preserve pw/groups/comment. Fixed a bug in dbmmanage that prevented the check option from parsing a password followed by :group... text.  Corrected the seed calcualation for Win32 systems, and added -lsdbm support. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Configured mod_auth_dbm to compile with sdbmlib under Win32. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Avoid a segfault when parsing .htaccess files.  An uninitialized tree pointer was passed to ap_build_config(). [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Change the way that inet_addr & inet_network are checked for in APR's configure process to allow BeOS BONE to correctly find them. With this change BeOS BONE now builds from source with no problems.  [David Reid]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix a bug parsing configuration file containers.  With a sequence like this in the config file <IfModule mod_kilroy.c> any stuff </IfModule> <IfModule mod_lovejoy.c> (blank line) any stuff </IfModule> the second container would be terminated at the blank line due to sediment in the buffer from reading the prior </IfModule> and an error message would be generated for the real </IfModule> for the second container.  Also due to this problem, any two characters could be used for ""</"" in the close of a container. [Jeff Trawick]"	
----------------------------
*) Modify mod_include to be a filter.  Currently, it has only been tested on actual files, but it should work for CGI scripts too. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
"*) NameVirtualHost can now take ""*"" as an argument instead of an IP address. This allows you to create a purely name-based virtual hosting server that does not have any IP addresses in the configuration file and which ignores the local address of any connections. PR #5595, PR #4455 [Tony Finch]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix chunking problem with CGI scripts.  The general problem was that the CGI modules were adding an EOS bucket and then the core added an EOS bucket.  The chunking filter finalizes the chunked response when it encounters an EOS bucket.  Because two EOS buckets were sent, we finalized the response twice.  The fix is to make sure we only send one EOS, by utilizing a flag in the request_rec. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix merging of AddDefaultCharset directive. PR #5872 (1.3) [Jun Kuriyama <kuriyama imgsrc.co.jp>]	
----------------------------
*) Add filtered I/O to Apache.  This is based on bucket brigades, Currently the buckets still use BUFF under the covers, but that should change quickly.  The only currently written filter is the core filter which just calls ap_bwrite.  [The Apache Group]	
----------------------------
*) Abort configuration if --with-layout was specified and there's no layout definition file.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Add support for '--with-port=n' option to configure.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) A configuration file parsing problem was fixed.  When the configuration file started with an IfModule/IfDefine container, only the last statement in the container would be retained. [Jeff Trawick] Changes with Apache 2.0a5	
----------------------------
*) Perchild is serving pages after passing them to different child processes.  There are still a lot of bugs, but this does work.  I have made requests against the same installation of Apache, and had different servers use different user IDs to serve the responses. This change moves to using socketpair instead of an AF_UNIX socket. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) The htdocs/ tree has been moved out of the CVS source tree into a separate area for easier development.  This has NO EFFECT on end-users or Apache installations.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Integrate the mod_dav module for WebDAV protocol handling. This adds the dav and dav_fs modules, the SDBM library, and additional XML handling utilities. [Greg Stein]	
----------------------------
*) If sizeof(long long) == sizeof(long), then prefer long in APR configure.in.  [Dave Hill <ddhill zk3.dec.com>]	
----------------------------
*) ab would start up more connections than needed, then quit when the desired number were finished. Also fixed a logic error involving ab keepalives.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]	
----------------------------
*) WinNT: Implement non-blocking pipes with timeouts to communicate with CGIs. Apache 2.0a4 had non-blocking pipes but without timeouts (i.e, if a timeout was specified, the pipe reverted to a full blocking pipe). Now the behaviour is more in line with Unix non-blocking pipes. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) WinNT: Implement accept socket reuse. Using mod_file_cache to cache open file handles along with accept socket reuse enables Apache 2.0 to serve non-keepalive requests for static files at 3x the rate of Apache 1.3.(e.g, Apache 1.3 will serve 400 rps and Apache 2.0 will serve almost 1200 rps on my system). [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Merge mod_mmap_static function into mod_file_cache. mod_file_cache supports two config directives, mmapfile (same behavious as mod_mmap_static) and cachefile. Use the cachefile directive to cache open file handles. This directive only works on systems that have implemented the ap_sendfile API. cachefile works today on Windows NT, but has not been tested on any flavors of Unix. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the configuration.  With the last few changes the configuration process automatically: inherits information about how to build from APR.  Allowing APR to inform Apache that it should or should not use -ldl Detects which mod_cgi should be used mod_cgi or mod_cgid, based on the threading model Apache calls APR's configure process before finishing it's configuration processing, allowing for more information flow between the two. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix error messages issued from MPMs which explain where to change compiled-in limits (e.g., ThreadsPerChild, MaxClients, StartTreads). [Greg Ames]	
----------------------------
*) ap_create_pipe() now leaves pipes in blocking state.  (This helps reduce the number of syscalls on Unix.)  ap_set_pipe_timeout() is now the way that the blocking state of a pipe is manipulated. ap_block_pipe() is gone.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Correct the problem where the only local host name that the IP stack can discover are 'undotted' private names.  If no fully qualified domain name can be identified, the default ServerName will be set to the machine's IP address string. A warning is always provided if the ServerName not specified, but assumed.  Solves PR6215 [William Rowe]

*) Repair problems with config file processing which caused segfault at init when virtual hosts were defined and which caused ServerName to be ignored when there was no valid DNS setup.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Repair C++ compatibility in ap_config.h, apr_file_io.h, apr_network_io.h, and apr_thread_proc.h. [Tyler J. Brooks <tylerjbrooks home.com>, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Change configuration command setup to be properly typesafe when in maintainer mode. Note that this requires a compiler that can initialise unions. [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Turn on buffering for config file reads.  Part of this was to repair buffered I/O support in Unix and implement buffered ap_fgets() for all platforms.  [Brian Havard, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Fix problem where UTC offset was not being set correctly in the access log. Problem reported on news group by Jerry Baker. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: CVE-2000-1204 (cve.mitre.org) Prevent the source code for CGIs from being revealed when using mod_vhost_alias and the CGI directory is under the document root and a user makes a request like http://www.example.com//cgi-bin/cgi as reported in <news:960999105.344321 ernani.logica.co.uk> [Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) When mod_cgid is started as root, the cgi daemon now switches to the configured User/Group (like other httpd processes) instead of continuing as root.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) The prefork MPM now uses an APR lock for the accept() mutex. It has not been getting a lock at all recently.  httpd -V now displays APR's selection of the lock mechanism instead of the symbols previously respected by prefork.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix typo in configure script when checking for mod_so.  bash doesn't seem to have a problem but /bin/sh on Solaris does. Symptom: ""./configure: test: unknown operator =="" [Jeff Trawick]"	
----------------------------
*) Move pre_config hook call to between configuration read and config tree walk.  This allows all modules to implement pre_config hooks and know that they will be called at an appropriate time. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) mod_cgi, mod_cgid: Make ScriptLog directive work again. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Add pre-config hooks back to all modules. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a SIGSEGV in ap_md5digest(), which is used when you have ContentDigest enabled and we can't/don't mmap the file. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) We now report the correct line number for syntax errors in config files.  [Ryan Bloom, Greg Stein, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Fix corruption of IFS variable in --with-module= handling. Depending on the user's shell or customization thereof, there would be errors generating ap_config_auto.h later in the configure procedure.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) mod_cgi: Restore logging of stderr from child process when ScriptLog isn't used (as in 1.3), except that on Unix it is now logged via ap_log_rerror() instead of by the child having STDERR_FILENO refer to the error log.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Add '-D' argument processing for run time configuration defines. [William Rowe]	
----------------------------
*) Add mod_charset_lite for configuring character set translation. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Add '-n' option to htpasswd to make it print its user:pw record on stdout rather than having to frob a text file.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix ap_resolve_env() so that it handles new function added in a prior alpha (see ""Added the capability to do ${ENVVAR} constructs in the config file."") as well as the constructs used by mod_rewrite. [Paul Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]"	
----------------------------
*) Add the ability to hook into the config file reading phase.  Basically if a directive is specified EXEC_ON_READ, then when that directive is read from the config file, the assocaited function is executed.  This should only be used for those directives that must muck with HOW the server INTERPRETS the config.  This should not be used for directives that re-order or replace items in the config tree.  Those changes should be made in the pre-config step. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Add mod_example to the build system. [Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a couple of problems in RFC1413 support (controlled by the IdentityCheck directive).  Apache did not build the request string properly and more importantly Apache would loop forever if the would-be ident server dropped the connection before sending a properly terminated response. [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Configure creates config.nice now containing your configure options. Syntax: ./config.nice [--more-options] [Sascha Schumann]	
----------------------------
*) Fix mm configuration on Solaris 8 x86 and OS/390.  Don't require /sbin in PATH on FreeBSD (all submitted to rse previously) [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) The configure option --with-program-name has been added to allow developers to rename the executable at configure time.  This also changes the name of the config files to match the executable's name. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) mod_autoindex: Add `IndexOptions +VersionSort', to nicely sort filenames containing version numbers. [Martin Pool]	
----------------------------
*) ap_set_pipe_timeout(), ap_poll(), and APR_SO_TIMEOUT now take microseconds instead of seconds.  Some storage leaks and other minor bugs in related code were fixed.  [Jeff Trawick]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Get non-blocking CGI pipe reads working under Windows NT. This addresses PR 1623. Still need to address timing out runaway CGI scripts. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Fix a bug in ap_get_oslevel which causes GetVersionEx() to always fail. Need to initialise the dwOSVersionInfoSize member of the OSVERSIONINFO struct before calling GetVersionEx, so GetVersionEx always fails. The patch also enhances ap_get_oslevel (and the associated enum) to handle selected service packs for NT4, and adds recognition for Windows 2000. This is useful, eg. if we can recognise NT4 SP2 then we can use ReadFileScatter and WriteFileGather in readwrite.c. [Tim Costello <Tim.Costello BTFinancialgroup.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Get APR DSO code working under Windows. Includes cross platform fixes to mod_so.c. [<Tim.Costello BTFinancialgroup.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Eliminate apr_win.h and apr_winconfig.h (and the ugly #ifdefs they cause). Now, apr.h and apr_config.h are generated from apr.hw and apr_config.hw at build time. At this point, the server will not compile on Windows because of the recent DSO commits. Fixing those next. [Bill Rowe & Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Allow BeOS to survive restarts, log properly and a few small things it had problems with due to the way it setup users and groups. [David Reid]	
----------------------------
*) Clear hook registrations between reads of the config file. When DSOs are unloaded and re-loaded the old hook pointers may no longer be valid. This fix eliminates potential segfaults. [Allan Edwards <ake raleigh.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a problem with Sigfunc not being defined or bypassed if sigaction() wasn't found. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Create one makefile for all Win32 distributions (NT/2000/95/98). Makefile.win includes the same user interface as the old Makefile.nt [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>, Jeff Trawick <trawick us.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Put in Korean and Norwegian index.html pages (2.0 and 1.3) which where donated by Lee Kuk Hyun and Lorant Czaran. 'Fixed' confusing ee/et name and made all extensions language/dialect rather than country reflecting. Changed example files to explicit reflect the ISO charset and added a few common ones to the example config [dirkx]	
----------------------------
*) Extend external module capability.  To use this, you call configure with --with-module=path/to/mod1,path/to/mod2,etc. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
"*) Backported the various ""default charset"" fixes from 1.3.12, including the AddDefaultCharset directive. [Jim Jagielski]"	
----------------------------
*) Added the capability to do ${ENVVAR} constructs in the config file. E.g. 'ServerAdmin ${POSTMASTER}'. As commited it does this on a line by line basis; i.e. if the envvar expands to something with spaces you have to protect it by adding quotes around it (Unless of course you expect it to contains more than one argument. Alternatively you can compile it on a per token basis; which is what people usually expect by setting RESOLVE_ENV_PER_TOKEN. But this hampers fancier hacks. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]	
----------------------------
"*) Changed the 'ErrorDocument' syntax in that it NO longer supports the asymetric ErrorDocument 301 ""Some message Note the opening "" quote, without a closing quote. It now has either the following syntaxes ErrorDocument XXX /local/uri ErrorDocument XXX http://valid/url ErrorDocument XXX ""Some Message"" The recognition heuristic is: if it has a space it is a message. If it has no spaces and starts with a / or is a valid URL then treat it that way. Otherwise it is assumed to be a message. This breaks backward compatibility but makes live a hell of a lot easier for GUI's and config file parsers. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]"	
----------------------------
*) Changed 'CacheNegotiatedDocs' from its present/not-present syntax into a 'on' or 'off' syntax. As it currently is the only non nesting token which uses NO_ARGS and thus is an absolute pain for any config interface automation. This breaks backward compatibility. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: More rigorous checking of Host: headers to fix security problems with mass name-based virtual hosting (whether using mod_rewrite or mod_vhost_alias). [Ben Hyde, Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) Add back support for UseCanonicalName in <Directory> containers. [Manoj Kasichainula]	
----------------------------
*) Cleaned APR build environment integration and bootstrap APR automatically for developers from src/Configure. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Support line-continuation feature in config.option file and allow the loading of multiple option sections at once via ``--with-option=<section1>,<section2>,...'' [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Implement the APACI --with-option facility (per default used the config.option file). [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Start to implement module-defined hooks that are a) fast and b) typesafe. Replace pre_connection module call with a register_hook call and implement pre_connection as a hook. The intent is that these hooks will be extended to allow Apache to be multi-protocol, and also to allow the calling order to be specified on a per-hook/per-module basis. [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) mpm_prefork: throw away all the alarm/timeout crud; and clean up the signal handling for the new world order.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Crude ap_thread_mutex abstraction so that we get the pthread stuff out of alloc.c for now.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) New buff option added: BO_TIMEOUT. It describes the timeout for buff operations (generally over a network). [Dean Gaudet, Ryan Bloom, Manoj Kasichainula]	
----------------------------
*) Created http_accept abstraction. Added 4 new functions (not exported): init_accept(), begin_accepting_requests(), get_request(), stop_accepting_requests() [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) user and ap_auth_type fields were moved from connection_rec to request_rec. [Ryan Bloom]	
----------------------------
*) Remove bogus error message when a redirect doesn't set Location. Instead, use an empty string to avoid coredump if the error message was supposed to include a location.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Don't allow configure to include mod_auth_digest unless it is explicitly requested, even if the user asked for all modules. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed generated AddModule adjustments in APACI's `configure' script in order to allow (new) modules like mod_vhost_alias to be handled correctly (which was touched by the adjustments for mod_alias). [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: Create the CGI script process as DETACHED.  This may solve the problem observed by some Win95/98 users where they get CGI script output sent to the console.  [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) Add description of -T command-line option to usage(). [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Flush the output buffer immediately after sending an error or redirect response, since the result may be needed by the client to abort a long data transfer or restart a series of pipelined requests. [Tom Vaughan <tvaughan aventail.com>, Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) RewriteLock/RewriteMap didn't work properly with virtual hosts. [Dmitry Khrustalev <dima bog.msu.su>] PR#3874	
----------------------------
*) Win32: More apache -k restart work. Restarts are now honored immediately and connections in the listen queue are -not- lost. This is made possible by the use of the WSADuplicateSocket() call.  The listeners are opened in the parent, duplicated, then the duplicates are passed to the child. The original listen sockets are not closed by the parent across a restart, thus the listen queue is preserved. [Bill Stoddard <stoddard raleigh.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Fix 'configure' to work correctly with SysV-based versions of 'tr' (consistent with Configure's use as well). [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
"*) apxs: Add ""-S var=val"" option which allows for override of CFG_* built-in values. Add ""-e"" option which works like -i but doesn't install the DSO; useful for editing httpd.conf with apxs. Fix editing code so that multiple invocations of apxs -a will not create duplicate LoadModule/AddModule entries; apxs can now be used to re- enable/disable a module.  [Wilfredo Sanchez]"	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Update the server to use Winsock 2. Specifically, link with ws2_32.lib rather than wsock32.lib.  This gives us access to WSADuplcateSocket() in addition to some other enhanced comm APIs. Win 95 users may need to update their TCP/IP stack to pick up Winsock 2. (See http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/) [Bill Stoddard <stoddard raleigh.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Redirect CGI script stderr (script debug info) into the error.log when CGI scripts fail. This makes Apache on Win32 behave more like Unix. [Bill Stoddard <stoddard raleigh.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Add the new mass-vhost module (mod_vhost_alias.c) developed and used by Demon Internet, Ltd. [Tony Finch <fanf demon.net>]	
----------------------------
*) DocumentRoot Checking: Under previous versions, when Apache first started up, it used to do a stat of each DocumentRoot to see if it existed and was a directory. If not, then an error message was printed. THIS HAS BEEN DISABLED. If DocumentRoot does not exist, you will get error messages in error_log. If the '-t' command line option is used (to check the configuration) the check of DocumentRoot IS performed. An additional command line option, '-T', has been added if you want to avoid the DocumentRoot check even when checking the configuration. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Changed behaviour of apache -k restart. Previously, the server would drain all connections in the stack's listen queue before honoring the restart. On a busy server, this could take hours.  Now, a restart is honored almost immediately. All connections in Apache's queues are handled but connections in the stack's listen queue are discarded. Restart triggered by MaxRequestPerChild is unchanged. [Bill Stoddard <stoddard raleigh.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Determine AP_BYTE_ORDER for ap_config_auto.h and already use this at least for Expat. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Allow SetEnvIf[NoCase] to test environment variables as well as header fields and request attributes.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) TestCompile updated. We can now run programs and output the results during the Configure process. [ Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
"*) The source is now quad (long long) aware as needed. Specifically, the Configure process determines the correct size of off_t and *void. When the OS/platform/compiler supports quads, ap_snprintf() provides for the 'q' format qualifier (if quads are not available, 'q' is silently ""demoted"" to long). [Jim Jagielski]"	
----------------------------
*) When the username or password fed to htpasswd is too long, include the size limit in the error message.  Also report illegal characters (currently only ':') in the username.  Add the size restrictions to the man page.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the configure --without-support option so it doesn't result in an infinite loop.  [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) Piped error logs could cause a segfault if an error occured during configuration after a restart. [Aidan Cully <aidan panix.com>] PR#4456	
----------------------------
"*) If a ""Location"" field was stored in r->err_headers_out rather than r->headers_out, redirect processing wouldn't find it and the server would core dump on ap_escape_html(NULL).  Check both tables and raise HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR with a log message if Location isn't set.  [Doug MacEachern, Ken Coar]"	
----------------------------
*) Add 'Request_Protocol' special keyword to mod_setenvif so that environment variables can be set according to the protocol version (e.g., HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.1) of the request.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fix sed regex for generating ap_config_auto.h in src/Configure. [Jan Gallo <gallo pvt.sk>] PR#3690, PR#4373	
----------------------------
*) Always log months in english format for %t in mod_log_config. [Petr Lampa <lampa fee.vutbr.cz>] PR#4366, 679	
----------------------------
"*) Support for server-parsed and multiview-determined ReadmeName and HeaderName files in mod_autoindex. Removed the restriction on ""/""s in ReadmeName and HeaderName directives since the *sub_req* routines will deal with the access issues. (It's now possible to have {site|group|project|customer|...} wide readmes and headers.) [Raymond S Brand <rsbx rsbx.net>, Ken Coar] PR#1574, 3026, 3529, 3569, 4256"	
----------------------------
*) Fix configuration engine re-entrant hangups, which solve a handful of problems seen with mod_perl <Perl> configuration sections [Salvador Ortiz Garcia <sog msg.com.mx>]	
----------------------------
*) Mac OS and Mac OS X Server now use the appropriate custom layout by default when building with APACI; allow for platform-specific variable defaults in configure. [Wilfredo Sanchez]	
----------------------------
*) Do setgid() before initgroups() in http_main; some platforms zap the grouplist when setgid() is called.  This was fixed in suexec earlier, but the main httpd code missed the change. [Rob Saccoccio <robs InfiniteTechnology.com>]  PR#2579	
----------------------------
*) Add iconsdir, htdocsdir, and cgidir to config.layout. [Wilfredo Sanchez]	
----------------------------
*) Fix minor but annoying bug with the test for Configuration.tmpl being newer than Configuration so that it is less likely to fail when using APACI and shadow sources. [Wilfredo Sanchez]	
----------------------------
"*) Rename Rhapsody layout to ""Mac OS X Server"". Change install locations to appropriate ones for user-built (as opposed to system) installs. [Wilfredo Sanchez]"	
----------------------------
*) Modify mod_autoindex's handling of AddDescription so that the behaviour matches the documentation.  [Ken Coar] PR#1898, 3072.	
----------------------------
*) Add functionality to the install-bindist.sh script created by binbuild.sh to use tar when copying distribution files to the serverroot. This allows upgrading an existing installation without nesting the new distribution in the old. install-bindist.sh now detects the local perl5 path to install apxs and dbmmanage with proper path to perl interpreter. Add an install-binsupport target which copies the source files for apxs and dbmmanage to bindist to allow these scripts to be properly installed relative to the destination serverroot. [Randy Terbush, Covalent Technologies, <randy covalent.net>]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed a bug in mod_dir that causes a child process will infinitely recurse when it attemps to handle a request for a directory wnd the value of the DirectoryIndex directive is a single dot. Also likely to happen for anyother values of DirectoryIndex that will map back to the same directory. The handler now only considers regular files as being index candidates. No PR#s found. [Raymond S Brand <rsbx rsbx.net>]	
----------------------------
"*) Ease configuration debugging by making TestCompile fall back to using ""make"" if the $MAKE variable is unset [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the ServerSignature directive to work as documented. [Raymond S Brand <rsbx rsbx.net>] PR#4248	
----------------------------
"*) Add ""opt"" (SysV-style) layout to config.layout. [Raymond S Brand <rsbx rsbx.net>]"	
----------------------------
*) Add support for OS/2 (case insenstive filesystem, .exe suffix, etc) to APACI files and related scripts. [Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes <sthoenna efn.org>, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#4269	
----------------------------
"*) Fix special RewriteCond ""-s"" pattern matching. [Bob Finch <bob nas.com>]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix value quoting in src/Configure script for ap_config_auto.h [Paul Sutton <paul awe.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Make sure RewriteLock can be used only in the global context, (i.e. outside of any <VirtualHost> sections) because it's a global facility of the rewrite engine. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) APACI would not correctly build suexec. [Maria Verina <mariav icgeb.trieste.it>] PR#4260	
----------------------------
"*) ""IndexOptions None"" generated extra spaces at the end of each line.  [<inkling firstnethou.com>] PR#3770"	
----------------------------
"*) The ""100 Continue"" response wasn't being sent after internal redirects. [Jose KAHAN <kahan w3.org>] PR#3910, 3806, 3575"	
----------------------------
*) PORT: deal with UTS compiler error in http_protocol.c [Dave Dykstra <dwd bell-labs.com>] PR#4189	
----------------------------
*) Fix a memory leak which is exacerbated by certain configurations. [Dean Gaudet] PR#4225	
----------------------------
*) EBCDIC platforms: David submitted patches for two bugs in the MD5 digest port for EBCDIC machines: a) the htdigest utility overwrote the old contents of the digest file b) the Content-MD5 header value (ContentDigest directive) was wrong when the returned file was not converted from EBCDIC, but was a binary (e.g., image file) in the first place. [David McCreedy <mccreedy us.ibm.com>]	
----------------------------
*) support/htpasswd now permits the password to be specified on the command line with the '-b' switch.  This is useful when passwords need to be maintained by scripts -- particularly in the Win32 environment.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Win32 multiple services patch. Added capability to install and run multiple copies of apache as individual services. Example 1: apache -n apache1 -i -f c:/httpd.conf Installs apache as service 'apache1' and associates c:/httpd.conf with that service. net start apache1 Starts apache1 service. net stop apache1 Stops apache1 service Example 2: apache -n apache2 -i Installs apache as service 'apache2'. httpd.conf is located under the default server root (/apache/conf/httpd.conf). net start apache2 Starts apache2 service. Example 3: apache -n apache3 -i -d c:/program files/apache Install apache as service 'apache3' and sets server root to c:/program files/apache. Example 4: apache -n apache2 -k restart Restart apache2 service [Keith Wannamaker, Ken Parzygnat, Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
"*) proxy ftp: instead of using the hardwired string ""text/plain"" as a fallback type for files served by the ftp proxy, use the ap_default_type() function to determine the configured type. This allows for special configurations like <Directory proxy:ftp://some.host> DefaultType gargle/blurb </Directory> Additionally, add the Content-Encoding: header to FTP proxy replies when the encoding is defined (by the AddEncoding directive). Because it was missing, it was almost impossible to browse compressed files using the FTP proxy (works now perfectly in Communicator). The ftp proxy now also returns the Date: and Server: header lines (if not much else... This code is ""somewhat"" broken) like normal requests do. [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Be more smart in APACI's configure script when determining the UID/GID for User/Group directives and use the determined UID/GID to initialize the permissions on the proxycachedir. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fix sed-substitutions in `make install': path elements like `httpd/conf' (for instance from an APACI configure --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/conf option) were substituted with $(TARGET).conf, etc. Same for other strings with dots where the dot wasn't matched as plain text. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fix verbose output of APACI configure (option -v) [Martin Kraemer, Ralf S. Engelschall] Changes with Apache 1.3.6	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: Binary installer now runs the configuration DLL before the reboot prompt (which is only given if MSVCRT.DLL system DLL is new or updated). This should avoid the configuration directory being empty after installation. [Paul Sutton] PR#3767, 3800, 3827, 3850, 3900, 3953, 3988	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: Binary installer now creates Start menu options to start and stop Apache as a console application and to uninstall the Apache service on NT. [Paul Sutton] PR#3741	
----------------------------
*) Using APACI, the main config file (usually httpd.conf) was not being adjusted as $(TARGET).conf. [Wilfredo Sanchez <wsanchez apple.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Move the directive `ExtendedStatus' in httpd.conf-dist-win _after_ the DSO/DLL section because it's a directive from mod_status and isn't available before the DLL of mod_status is loaded. [Martin POESCHL <mpoeschl gmx.net>] PR#3936	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: Fix a bug in the calculation of the buffer size for the line continuation facility in Apache's configuration files which could lead to a buffer overflow situation. [Thomas Devanneaux <Thomas.Devanneaux enst.fr>] PR#3617	
----------------------------
*) Let APACI's configure script correctly complain for unknown --enable-XXX and --disable-XXX options. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3958	
----------------------------
"*) Add Apple's Mac OS X Server Layout ""Rhapsody"" to config.layout. [Wilfredo Sanchez]"	
----------------------------
"*) In configure, do not append the target name to the directory path if the path already contains ""apache"".  [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) Add %V to mod_log_config, this logs the hostname according to the UseCanonicalName setting (this is the pre-1.3.4 behaviour of %v).  Useful for mass vhosting.  [Tony Finch <dot dotat.at>]	
----------------------------
*) Add support for \n and \t to mod_log_config, can be used to produce more reliable logs with multiline entries.  [Tony Finch <dot dotat.at>]	
----------------------------
*) OS/2 ap_os_canonical_filename()'s behaviour is improved: ap_assert() is removed. This allows <Directory proxy:*> directives to work and prevents invalid requests from killing the process. [Brian Havard <brianh kheldar.apana.org.au>]	
----------------------------
*) src/support/: The ApacheBench benchmark program was overhauled by David N. Welton: you can now have it generate an HTML TABLE, presumably for integration into other HTML sources. David updated the ab man page as well and added some missing descriptions. Thanks! [David N. Welton <davidw prosa.it>]	
----------------------------
*) Win32: The filename validity checker now allows filenames containing characters in the range 0x80 to 0xff (for example accented characters). [Paul Sutton] PR#3890	
----------------------------
*) Added conditional logging based upon environment variables to mod_log_config.  mod_log_referer and mod_log_agent are now deprecated.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Added -S option to install.sh so that options can be passed to strip on some platforms. [Ralf S. Engelschall, Wilfredo Sanchez]	
----------------------------
*) Tweak modules Makefile generated by Configure so that it handles the test case of no modules being selected. [<chaz reliant.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Added a <LimitExcept method ...> sectioning directive that allows the user to assign authentication control to any HTTP method that is *not* given in the argument list; i.e., the logical negation of the <Limit> directive.  This is particularly useful for controlling access on methods unknown to the Apache core, but perhaps known by some module or CGI script. [Roy Fielding, Tony Finch]	
----------------------------
*) Prevent apachectl from complaining if the PIDFILE exists but does not contain a process id, as might occur if the server is being rapidly restarted. [Wilfredo Sanchez]	
----------------------------
"*) proxy: The various calls to ap_proxyerror() can return HTTP/1.1 status code different from 500. This allows the proxy to, e.g., return ""403 Forbidden"" for ProxyBlock'ed URL's. [Martin Kraemer] Related to PR#3455"	
----------------------------
*) Win32: Add new config directive, ScriptInterpreterSource, to enable searching the Win32 registry for script interpreters. [Bill Stoddard]	
----------------------------
"*) Win32: Any error messages from -i or -u command line options are now displayed on the console output rather than sent to the error log. Also the ""Running Apache..."" message is not output unless Apache is going to serve requests. [Paul Sutton]"	
----------------------------
*) Let src/Configure be aware of CFLAGS options starting with plus signs as it's the case for the HP/UX compiler. [Doug Yatcilla <yatcilda umdnj.edu>] PR#3681	
----------------------------
"*) A consistent and conservative style for all shell scripts has been implemented. Basically, all shell string tests use the traditional hack of 'if [ ""x$var"" != ""x"" ]' or 'if [ ""x$var"" = ""xstring"" ]' to protect against bare null variable strings (ie: wrapping both sides with double quotes and prepending 'x'). 'x' was chosen because it's more universal and hopefully easier for old shell prgrammers, as well as being easier to search for in 'vi' (/x\$) :) [Jim Jagielski]"	
----------------------------
*) Renamed macros status_drops_connection to ap_status_drops_connection and vestigial scan_script_header to ap_scan_script_header_err, mostly for aesthetic reasons. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) IndexOptions SuppressColumnSorting only turned off making the column headers anchors; you could still change the display order by manually adding a '?N=A' or similar query string to the URL.  Now SuppressColumnSorting locks in the sort order so it can't be overridden this way.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Added IndexOrderDefault directive to supply a default sort order for FancyIndexed directory listings.  [Ken Coar] PR#1699	
----------------------------
*) Instead of fixing a bug in the generation procedure for config.status (a backslash was missing) we remove the bug together with it's complete context because the special cases of the past can now no longer occur because of the recent magic for the --with-layout default. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3590	
----------------------------
*) Two minor enhancements to mod_rewrite: First RewriteRule now also supports the ``nocase|NC'' flag (as RewriteCond already does for ages) to match case insensitive (this especially avoids nasty patterns like `[tT][eE][sS][tT]'). Second two additional internal map functions `escape' and `unescape' were added which can be used to escape/unescape to/from hex-encodings in URLs parts (this is especially useful in combination with map lookups). [Magnus Bodin, Ian Kallen, Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fix some inconsistencies related to the scopes of directives. The only user visible change is that the directives `UseCanonicalName' and `ContentDigest' now use the (more correct) `Options' scope instead of (less correct) `AuthConfig' scope.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) When modules update/modify the file name in the configfile_t structure, syntax errors will report the updated name, not the original one. [Fabien Coelho <coelho cri.ensmp.fr>] PR#3573	
----------------------------
*) For %v log ServerName regardless of the UseCanonicalName setting (similarly for %p).  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Configure was initializing the variables $OSDIR, $INCDIR and $SHELL rather late (too late for some invocations of TestCompile). This improves the make environment available to TestCompile and the *.module scripts. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) The hashbang emulation code in ap_execve.c would interpret #!/hashbang/scripts correctly, but failed to fall back to a standard shell for scripts which did NOT start with #! Now SHELL_PATH is started in these cases. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the command line options: `-?' was documented to show the usage list but does it with an error because `?' is not a valid command. OTOH a lot of users expect `-h' to print such a usage list and instead are annoyed for ages by our huge unreadable list of directives. So we now changed the command line options this way: 1. `-L' => `-R' Intent: we need `-L' to be free, and `-R' for the DSO run-time path is very similar to the popular linker option. 2. `-h' => `-L' Intent: while -l gives the small list of modules, -L now gives the large list of directives implemented by these modules.  This is also consistent with -v (short version info) and -V (large version info). 3. `-?' => `-h' Intent: it's now the expected option ;-) The manual page was adjusted accordingly. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2714	
----------------------------
*) Fixed problem of fclose() on an unopened file in suexec if LOG_EXEC wasn't defined.  [Rick Franchuk <rickf transpect.net>]	
----------------------------
"*) Removed recently introduced bugs and disfigurements in APACI: o fixed argument line processing: using $args was broken: It was not initialized and using args=""$args $apc_option"" and even args=""$args \""$apc_option\"""" fails in the second processing round for any arguments containing whitespaces. The only correct way is to use the construct ""$@"" (but not possible here) or iterate _both_ times over the implicit argument line (no argument to for-loop) which is what we now use. o make --with-layout=Apache the default without creating redundancy (copying the --with-layout block in the argument parsing loop).  We achieve this by using the ""$@"" construct together with the `set' command to prepend --with-layout=Apache to the command line in case --with-layout is not used. o fixed auto-suffix handling now that config.layout exists. Paths which are auto-suffixed are marked with a trailing plus sign in config.layout and every path now can be marked this way (not only the four paths for which we do it currently).  Additionally the suffix is no longer a static one. Instead it's now `/<target>' where <target> is the argument of the --target option or per default `httpd'. o allow also tabs (and only spaces) where we match whitespaces o various fixes and cleanups related to used shell coding style o made Jim happy by replacing `Written by' with `Initially written by' ;-) o trimmed output of --help to fit into 80 columns [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) Added two new core API functions, ap_single_module_configure() and ap_single_module_init(), which are now used by mod_so to configure a module after loading. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: Add defines for USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT and SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT to NetBSD/OpenBSD section of ap_config.h to allow serialized accept for multiport listens. [Roy Fielding, Curt Sampson] PR#3120	
----------------------------
*) PORT: Fixed a misplaced #endif for NetBSD/OpenBSD section of ap_config.h that would skip several defines if DEFAULT_GROUP was overridden. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: The I86 version of DGUX has support for strncasecmp and strcasecmp, so allow it in ap_config.h. [Amiel Lee Yee] PR#3247	
----------------------------
*) Fix ordering of definitions in ap_config.h so that ap_inline is defined before it might be used. [Victor Khimenko]	
----------------------------
"*) Make generation of src/Configuration.apaci more robust: It failed to differenciate between modules when one module name was a postfix of another (e.g. cgi vs. fastcgi). We now check for mod_XXX, libXXX and even just XXX (think about totally non-standard names like ""apache_ssl"", too). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3380"	
----------------------------
*) In src/Configure remove the SERVER_SUBVERSION support (already deprecated since 1.3b7) and make whitespace handling more robust (it failed horrible when whitespaces were present in the arguments of -D options). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#3240	
----------------------------
*) Fix negotiation so that we prefer an encoded variant over an unencoded variant if the user-agent explicitly says it can accept that encoding. Previously we always preferred the unencoded variant. [Paul Ausbeck <paula alumni.cse.ucsc.edu>, Paul Sutton] PR#3447	
----------------------------
*) Allow special options -Wc,xxx and -Wl,xxx on APXS compile/link command. They can occur multiple times and their arguments (`xxx') are passed AS IS to the compiler/linker command.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Added a generic --with-layout=[FILE:]ID option. ID here is a layout identifier, currently ""Apache"" and ""GNU"" are pre-defined in the file config.layout.  Custom layouts are possible by using FILE:ID as the argument where the layout ID is taken from FILE. The config.layout file consists of <Layout ID>..</Layout> sections where inside those sections ""path_variable: path_value"" pairs can be specified. These lines are converted to path_variable='path_value'."	
----------------------------
*) Add a DefaultLanguage directive so that files missing a language extension (e.g., .fr, .de) can be labelled as being some other default language. DefaultLanguage can appear in <Directory> and <Files> containers as well as .htaccess files.  [Paul Sutton] PR#1180	
----------------------------
*) Fix TARGET configuration when configuring and installing using APACI configure. TARGET now defines the basename of the configuration file, startup script, manual page, etc. log_error_core() now reports the server binary name given by argv[0]. TARGET can now also be defined with --target=TARGET parameter passed to APACI configure. [Ralf Engelschall, Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) API: ap_exists_config_define() function is now ""public"" [Doug MacEachern]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix documentation of `Action' directive: It can activate a CGI script when either a handler or a MIME content type is triggered by the request. [Andrew Pimlott <pimlott math.harvard.edu>] PR#3340	
----------------------------
"*) Ignore a ""ErrorDocument 401"" directive with a full URL and write a notice to the error log. It is not possible to send a 401 response and a redirect at the same time.  [Lars Eilebrecht]"	
----------------------------
*) Add APACI --suexec-docroot and --suexec-logfile options which can be used to set the document root directory (DOC_ROOT) and the suexec logfile (LOG_EXEC), respectively. Additionally the --layout option was changed to show more information about the suEXEC setup. [Lars Eilebrecht] PR#3316, 3357, 3361	
----------------------------
*) Enabled all of the WebDAV method names for use by third-party modules, Limit, and Script directives.  That includes PATCH, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, and UNLOCK. Improved mod_actions.c so that it can use any of the methods defined in httpd.h.  Added ap_method_number_of(method) for getting the internal method number.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: Log more explicit error messages if spawning an interpreted script failed, including the command line used to attempt to execute the interpreter and the Win32 error code returned.  [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) http_config.c would respond with 501 (Method Not Implemented) if a content type handler was specified but could not be found, which should have been a 500 response.  Likewise, mod_proxy.c would responsd with a 501 if the URI scheme is unrecognized instead of the correct response of 403 (Forbidden).  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fix in mod_autoindex: for files where the last modified time stamp was unavailable, an empty string was printed which was 2 bytes short. The size and description columns were therefore not aligned correctly. [Martin Kraemer] (no PR#)	
----------------------------
*) Add APACI --permute-module=foo:bar option which can be used to on-the-fly/batch permute the order of two modules (mod_foo and mod_bar) in the Configuration[.apaci] file. Two special and important variants are supported for the option argument: first BEGIN:foo which permutes module mod_foo with the begin of the module list, i.e. it `moves' the module to the begin of the list (gives it lowest priority).  And second foo:END which permutes mod_foo with the end of the module list, i.e. it `moves' the module to the end of the list (gives it highest priority). [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) The config parser wasn't correctly noticing a missing '>' on container start lines (e.g., it wouldn't spot ""<Directory /"" as a syntax error).  [Ryan Bloom <rbbloom us.ibm.com>] PR#3279"	
----------------------------
*) Add a 'RemoveHandler' directive which will selectively remove all handler associations for the specified file extensions. [Ryan Bloom <rbbloom us.ibm.com>] PR#1799.	
----------------------------
"*) Properly handle & allow ""nul"" and "".*/null"" in AccessConfig and ResourceConfig directives on Win32.  Also add a note to the effect of 'useless User directive ignored on Win32' to the errorlog if a User directive is encountered on Win32. [Ken Parzygnat <kparz raleigh.ibm.com>] PR#2078, 2303."	
----------------------------
*) Fix inheritance of IndexOptions NameWidth and remove unintended restriction on +NameWidth, +IconHeight, and +IconWidth.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fix per-directory config merging for cases in which a 500 error is encountered in an .htaccess file somewhere down the tree. [Ken Coar]  PR#2409	
----------------------------
*) Remove extra trailing whitespace from the getline results as part of the protocol processing, which is extra nice because it works between continuation lines, is almost no cost in the normal case of no extra whitespace, and saves memory. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a possible race condition between timed-out requests and the ap_bhalfduplex select that might result in an infinite loop on platforms that do not validate the descriptor. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
"*) WIN32: Add ""-k shutdown"" and ""-k restart"" options to signal a running Apache server [Paul Sutton]"	
----------------------------
*) Add the server signature text (from the core ServerSignature directive) to the list of envariables available to scripts, SSI, and the like. [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fix the SERVER_NAME variable under sub-request situations (where `UseCanonicalName off' is used) like CGI's called from SSI pages or RewriteCond variables by adopting r->hostname to sub-requests. [James Grinter <jrg blodwen.demon.co.uk>] PR#3111	
----------------------------
*) Fix stderr redirection under syslog-based error logging situation. [Youichirou Koga <y-koga jp.FreeBSD.org>] PR#3095	
----------------------------
*) Document `ErrorLog syslog:facility' variant of error logging. [Youichirou Koga <y-koga jp.FreeBSD.org>] PR#3096	
----------------------------
*) Quote paths in default configuration files.  [Wilfredo Sanchez]	
----------------------------
*) Fix problem with scripts and filehandle inheritance on Win32. [Ken Parzygnat <kparz raleigh.ibm.com>]  PR#2884, 2910	
----------------------------
*) Add [REDIRECT_]VARIANTS environment variable to mod_speling so that ErrorDocument 300 processors can reformat the list if desired.  [Ken Coar] PR#2859	
----------------------------
*) Add +/- incremental prefixes to IndexOptions keywords, and enable merging of multiple IndexOptions directives.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) OS/2: The new header tests get things right, need to update ap_config.h.  [Brian Havard]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: Add Pyramid DC/OSx support to configuration mechanism. [Earle Ake <akee wpdiss1.wpafb.af.mil>]	
----------------------------
*) Correct comment in mod_log_config.c about its internals. [Elf Sternberg <elf halcyon.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Avoid possible line overflow in Configure: Use an awkfile to handle the creation of modules.c [Jim Jagielski] Changes with Apache 1.3.2	
----------------------------
*) Add support for Berkeley-DB/2.x (in addition to Berkeley-DB/1.x) to mod_auth_db to both be friendly to users who wants to use this version and to avoid problems under platforms where only version 2.x is present. [Dan Jacobowitz <drow false.org>, Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) BS2000 platform only: get rid of the nasty BS2000AuthFile. You now must define a BS2000Account name for the server User. This has fewer security implications than the old approach. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Fix APACI's `Group' configuration adjustment - especially for Linux platforms where `nogroup' exists in /etc/group. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fix the recently introduced C header file checking: We now use the C pre-processor pass only (and no longer the complete compiler pass) to determine whether a C header file exists or not. Because only this way we're safe against inter-header dependencies (which caused horrible portability problems). The only drawback is that we now have a CPP configuration variable which has to be determined first (we do a similar approach as GNU Autoconf does here). When all fails the user still has the possibility to override it manually via APACI or src/Configuration. As a fallback for the header check itself we can directly check the existance of the file under /usr/include, too. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2777	
----------------------------
*) Fix possible buffer overflow situation in suexec.c. [Jeff Stewart <jws purdue.edu>] PR#2790	
----------------------------
*) Fix documentation of ProxyPass/ProxyPassReverse according to the trailing slash problem. [Jon Drukman <jsd gamespot.com>] PR#2933	
----------------------------
"*) Allow ""Include"" directives anywhere in the server config files (but not .htaccess files).  [Ken Coar] PR#2727"	
----------------------------
*) The proxy was refusing to serve CONNECT requests except to port 443 (https://) and 563 (snews://). The new AllowCONNECT directive allows the configuration of the ports to which a CONNECT is allowed.  [Sameer Parekh, Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
"*) Problems encountered during .htaccess parsing or CGI execution that lead to a ""500 Server Error"" condition now provide explanatory text (in the *ERROR_NOTES envariable) to ErrorDocument 500 scripts. [Ken Coar] PR#1291"	
----------------------------
*) Add NameWidth keyword to IndexOptions directive so that the width of the filename column is customisable.  [Ken Coar, Dean Gaudet] PR#1949, 2324.	
----------------------------
*) The <IfModule and <IfDefine block starting directives now only allow exactly one argument. Previously, the optional negation character '!' could be separated by whitespace without a syntax error being reported, albeit defeating the IfModule functionality (enclosed directives would ALWAYS be executed). By using the stricter syntax, these hard-to-track errors can be avoided. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Simplify handling of IndexOptions in mod_autoindex -- and BTW cause the standalone FancyIndexing directive to logically OR into any existing IndexOptions settings rather than wiping them out.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
"*) Changes in ftp proxy: make URL parsing simpler by using the parsed_uri stuff. + Add display of the ""current directory"" in cases where it's different from the supplied path (e.g., ftp://user@host/ lives in /home/user, not in /, therefore clicking on ""../"" in the starting directory might send us to /home/). + When ftp login fails, (esp. when a user name was part of the URL already), we now return [401 Unauthorized ] to allow the browser to pop up an authorization dialog. This makes passwords slightly less visible (they don't appear in the regular log files) and implements a functionality that other www proxy servers already offered. [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) new `GprofDir' directive when compiled with -DGPROF, where gprof can plop gmon.out profile data for each child [Doug MacEachern]	
----------------------------
"*) Use the construct ``""$@""'' instead of ``$*'' in the generated config.status script to be immune against arguments with whitespaces. [Yves Arrouye <yves apple.com>] PR#2866"	
----------------------------
*) Replace the inlined information grabbing stuff for the configuration adjustment feature (no --without-confadjust) with calls to a new helper script `buildinfo.sh' which is both more flexible and already proofed to be more robust against platform differences. This mainly fixes the recently occured ``sed: command garbled: ...'' problems. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2776, PR#2848	
----------------------------
*) Bump up MAX_ENV_FLAGS in mod_rewrite.h from the too conservatice limit of 5 to 10 because there are some users out there who always have 5 to 8 variables in one RewriteRule and had to patch mod_rewrite.h for every release. So 15 should be now more than enough, even for them. (I never needed more than 4 in my RewriteRules ;-) [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Make sure the config.status file is not overridden when just ``configure --help'' is used. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2844	
----------------------------
*) Fix suexec installation under `make install root=xxx' situation. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Extend the output of the -V switch to include the paths of all compiled-in configuration files, if they were overridden at compile time, for least astonishment of the user. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
"*) When READing a request in ExtendedStatus mode, the ""old"" vhost, request and client information is not displayed. [Jim Jagielski]"	
----------------------------
*) STATUS is no longer available. Full status information now run-time configurable using the ExtendedStatus directive. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) SECURITY: Added compile-time and configurable limits for various aspects of reading a client request to avoid some simple denial of service attacks, including limits on maximum request-line size (LimitRequestLine), number of header fields (LimitRequestFields), and size of any one header field (LimitRequestFieldsize).  Also added a configurable directive LimitRequestBody for limiting the size of the request message body.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a problem with the new OS/2 mutexes.  [Brian Havard]	
----------------------------
*) Enhance mod_speling so that CheckSpelling can be used in <Directory> containers and .htaccess files.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) API: new ap_custom_response() function for hooking into the ErrorDocument mechanism at runtime [Doug MacEachern]	
----------------------------
"*) API: scan_script_header_err_core() now ""public"" and renamed ap_scan_script_header_err_core() [Doug MacEachern]"	
----------------------------
*) The IRIXN32 Rule was being ignored. Configure now correctly adds -n32 only if IRIXN32 says to. [Jim Jagielski, Alain St-Denis <alain.st-denis ec.gc.ca>] PR#2736	
----------------------------
*) Fix suEXEC start message: Has to be of `notice' level to really get printed together with the standard startup message because the `notice' level is handled special inside ap_log_error() for startup messages. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2761 PR#2761 PR#2765	
----------------------------
*) Fixed examples in mod_rewrite.html document. [Youichirou Koga <y-koga jp.FreeBSD.org>, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2756	
----------------------------
*) One more portability fix for APACI shadow tree support: Swap order of awk and sed in top-level configure script to avoid sed fails on some platforms (for instance SunOS 4.1.3 and NCR SysV) because of the non-newline-termined output of Awk. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2729	
----------------------------
*) Fix Win32 part of ap_spawn_child() by providing a reasonable child_info structure instead of just NULL. This fixes at least the RewriteMap programs under Win32. [Marco De Michele <mdemichele tin.it>] PR#2483	
----------------------------
*) Add workaround to top-level `configure' script for brain dead `echo' commands which interpet escape sequences per default. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2654	
----------------------------
*) Make sure that the path to the Perl interpreter is correctly adjusted under `make install' also for the printenv CGI script. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2595	
----------------------------
*) Fix `install-includes' sub-target of `install' target in top-level Makefile.tmpl: The umask+cp approach didn't work as expected (especially for users which extracted the distribution under 'umask 077'), so replace it by an explicit cp+chmod approach. [Richard Lloyd, Curt Sampson, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2656 PR#2626	
----------------------------
*) Use a more straight forward and thus less problematic Sed command in src/helper/mkdir.sh script.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Make sure the `configure' scripts doesn't fail when trying to guess the domainname of the machine and there are multiple `domainname' and `search' entries in /etc/resolv.conf. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2710	
----------------------------
*) Add note about the SHARED_CORE requirement on some platforms also to the INSTALL file because a lot of users don't read htdocs/manual/dso.html first. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2701	
----------------------------
"*) Fix document ""hyperlink"" for dso.html in src/Configuration.tmpl [Knut A.Syed <Knut.Syed nhh.no>] PR#2674"	
----------------------------
*) Fix broken RANLIB handling in src/Configure (the entry from src/Configuration.tmpl was ignored) and additionally force RANLIB to /bin/true under HP/UX where ranlib exists but is deprecated. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2627	
----------------------------
"*) WIN32: Canonicalize ServerRoot before checking to see if it is a valid directory.  The failure to do this caused certain ServerRoot settings (eg. ""ServerRoot /apache"") to be improperly rejected.  [Marc Slemko]"	
----------------------------
*) Global renaming of C header files to both get rid of conflicts with third party packages and to again reach consistency: 1. conf.h      -> ap_config.h 2. conf_auto.h -> ap_config_auto.h \ these are now merged 3. ap_config.h -> ap_config_auto.h / in the config process 4. compat.h    -> ap_compat.h 5. apctype.h   -> ap_ctype.h Backward compatibility files for conf.h and compat.h were created.	
----------------------------
"*) mod_mmap_static will no longer take action on requests unless at least one ""mmapfile"" directive is present in the configuration. This experimental module has to do some black magic to operate inside the current API and thus creates side-effects for other modules under some circumstances. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) Add conservative ticks around more egrep arguments in top-level configure to avoid problems under brain-dead platforms like Digital UNIX (OSF1). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2596	
----------------------------
"*) mod_setenvif (BrowserMatch* and friends) will now match a missing field with ""^$"".  [Ken Coar]"	
----------------------------
*) Cache a proxied request in the event that the client cancels the transfer, provided that the configured percentage of the file has already been transferred. It works for HTTP transfers only.  The new configuration directive is called CacheForceCompletion. [Glen Parker <glenebob nwlink.com>] PR#2277	
----------------------------
*) suexec's error messages have been clarified a little bit.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Clean up some, but perhaps not all, 8-bit character set problems with config file parsing, and URL parsing.  We now define ap_isdigit(), ap_isupper(), ... which cast to an (unsigned char). This should work on most modern unixes. [Dean Gaudet] PR#800, 2282, 2553  (and others)	
----------------------------
*) The <Limit> parsing routine was incorrectly treating methods as case-insensitive.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix the Guess-DSO-flags-from-Perl stuff in src/Configure: ""perl"" was used instead of ""$PERL"" which contains the correctly determined Perl interpreter (important for instance on systems where ""perl"" and ""perl5"" exists, like BSDI or FreeBSD, etc). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2505"	
----------------------------
*) Move the initial suEXEC-related startup message from plain fprintf()/stderr to a delayed ap_log_error()-based one to avoid problems when Apache is started from inetd (instead of standalone). Under this situation startup messages on stderr lead to problems (the line is sent to the client in front of the requested document). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#871, PR#1318	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: If we can't figure out how to execute a file in a script directory, bail out of the request with an error message.  [W G Stoddard]	
----------------------------
*) IndexIgnore should be case-blind on Win32 (and any other case-aware but case-insensitive platforms).  New #define for this added to conf.h (CASE_BLIND_FILESYSTEM).  [Ken Coar] PR#2455	
----------------------------
*) Let APACI's configure script determine some configuration parameters (Group, Port, ServerAdmin, ServerName) via some intelligent tests to remove some of the classical hurdles for new users when setting up Apache. This is done per default because it is useful for the average user. Package authors can use the --without-confadjust option to disable these configuration adjustments. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Added an EXTRA_DEPS configuration parameter which can be used to add an extra Makefile dependency for the httpd target, for instance to external third-party libraries, etc. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Add <IfDefine>..</IfDefine> sections to the core module (with same spirit as <IfModule>..</IfModule> sections) which can be used to skip or process contained commands dependend of ``-D PARAMETER'' options on the command line. This can be used to achieve logical conditions like <IfDefine ReverseProxy> instead of physically ones (e.g. <IfModule mod_proxy.c>) and thus especially can be used for conditionally loading DSO-based modules via LoadModule, etc. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Portability fix for APACI shadow tree support: Swap order of awk and sed in top-level configure script to avoid sed fails on some platforms (for instance SunOS 4.1.3 and NCR SysV) because of the non-newline-termined output of Awk. [Bill Houle <bhoule sandiegoca.ncr.com>] PR#2435	
----------------------------
*) Add a tiny but useful goody to APACI's configure script: The generation of a config.status script (as GNU Autoconf does) which remembers the used configure command and hence can be used to restore the configuration by just re-running this script or for remembering the configuration between releases. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Add httpd -t (test) option for running configuration syntax tests only. If something is broken it complains and exits with a return code non-equal to 0. This can be used manually by the user to check the Apache configuration after editing and is also automatically used by apachectl on (graceful) restart command to make sure Apache doesn't die on restarts because of a configuration which is now broken since the last (re)start. This way `apachectl restart' can be used inside cronjobs without having to expect Apache to be falling down. Additionally the httpd -t can be run via `apachectl configtest'. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2393	
----------------------------
*) Apache would incorrectly downcase the entire Content-Type passed from CGIs.  This affected server-push scripts and such which use multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=ThisRandomString. [Dean Gaudet] PR#2394

*) mod_log_config wouldn't let vhosts use log formats defined in the main server.  [Christof Damian <damian mediaconsult.com>] PR#2090	
----------------------------
*) mod_usertrack was corrupting the client hostname.  As part of the fix, the cookie values were slightly extended to include the fully qualified hostname of the client. [Dean Gaudet] PR#2190, 2229, 2366	
----------------------------
"*) Change ""Options None"" to ""Options FollowSymLinks"" in the <Directory /> section of the default access.conf-dist (and -win even though it doesn't matter there).  This has better performance, and more intuitive semantics.  [Dean Gaudet]"	
----------------------------
*) Workaround for configure script and old `test' commands which do not support the -x flag (for instance under platforms like Ultrix). This is solved by another helper script findprg.sh which searches for Perl and Awk like PrintPath but _via different names_. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Proxy Cache Fixes: account for directory sizes, fork off garbage collection to continue in background, use predefined types (off_t, size_t, time_t), log the current cache usage percentage at LogLevel debug [Martin Kraemer, based on discussion between Dean Gaudet & Dirk vanGulik] Changes with Apache 1.3.0

*) Propagate environment to CGI scripts correctly in Win32. [W G Stoddard <wgstodda us.ibm.com>] PR#2294	
----------------------------
*) Upgrade the child spawning code in mod_rewrite for the RewriteMap programs: ap_spawn_child_err() is used and the Win32 case now uses CreateProcess() instead of a low-level execl() (which caused problems in the past under Win32). [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) A few cosmetics and trivial enhancements to APXS to make the generated Makefile more user friendly. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Proxy Fix: The proxy special failure routine ap_proxyerror() was updated to use the normal apache error processing, thereby allowing proxy errors to be treated by ErrorDocument's as well. For this purpose, a new module-to-core communication variable ""error-notes"" was introduced; the proxy (and possibly other modules) communicates its error text using this variable. Its content is copied to a new cgi-env-var REDIRECT_ERROR_NOTES for use by ErrorDocuments. The old proxy special error routine ap_proxy_log_uerror() was replaced by regular ap_log_error() calls, many messages were made more informative. [Martin Kraemer] PR#494, 1259"	
----------------------------
"*) Transform the configure message ""You need root privileges for suEXEC"" from a fatal error into a (more friendly) warning because the building (""make"") of Apache we can allow, of course. Root privileges are needed only for the installation step (""make install""). So make sure the user is aware of this fact but let him proceed as long as he can. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2288"	
----------------------------
*) Make sure a MIME-type can be forced via a RewriteRule even when no substitution takes place, for instance via the following rule: ``RewriteRule ^myscript$ - [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]'' This was often requested by users in the past to force a single script without a .cgi extension and outside any cgi-bin dirs to be executed as a CGI program. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2254	
----------------------------
*) A fix for protocol issues surrounding 400, 408, and 414 responses. [Ed Korthof]

"*) Fix support script `dbmmanage': It was unable to handle some sort of passwords, especially passwords with ""0"" chars. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2242"	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: CGIs could cause a hang (because of a deadlock in the standard C library), so CGI handling has been changed to use Win32 native handles instead of C file descriptors. [Ben Laurie and Bill Stoddard <wgstodda us.ibm.com>] PR#1129, 1607	
----------------------------
*) Replace the AddVersionPlatform directive with ServerTokens which provides for more control over the format of the Server: header line. SERVER_SUBVERSION is no longer supported; all module should use the ap_add_version_component() API function instead. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) The LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT variable of src/Configuration[.tmpl] was not retrieved in src/Configure and thus was not useable. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Various Makefile consistency cleanups: - make OSDIR also automatically be relative to src/ like INCDIR - SUBDIRS is now generated in src/Makefile only and not in Makefile.config because it is a local define for this location. - remove BROKEN_BPRINTF_FLAGS because is it no longer used inside any Makefile but make sure that at least the ""-K inline"" is kept in CFLAGS for SCO 5. - update the ""depend"" targets in Makefile.tmpl files to use $(OSDIR), too. - updated the dependencies theirself - removed not existing SHLIB variable from ""clean"" targets - replaced SHLIB_OBJS/SHLIBS_OBJ consistently with OBJS_PIC because OBJS already exists and OBJS_PIC are also just plain objects and have not directly to do with ""shared"" things. The only difference is that they contain PIC. So OBJS_PIC is the more canonical name. - Updated the Makefile-dependency lines for OBJS_PIC - Removed the Makefile-dependency line in Configure to avoid double definitions - replaced ugly xx-so.o/xx.so-o hack with a clean and consistent usage of xxx.lo as GNU libtool does with its PIC objects - reduce local complexity in modules Makefile.tmpl by moving the last existing target ""depend"" to the generation section in Configure, too. - removed the historical $(SPACER) which was used in the past together with BROKEN_BPRINTF_FLAGS to avoid zig-zags in the build process. This is no longer needed. - force the build and run of the gen_xxx programs under main/ as the first step before building the objects because it looks cleaner [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
"*) When opening ""configuration"" files (like httpd.conf, htaccess and htpasswd), Apache will not allow them to be non-/dev/null device files. This closes a DoS hole. At the same time, we use ap_pfopen to open these files to handle timeouts. [Jim Jagielski, Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Apache will now log the reason its httpd children exit if they exit due to an unexpected signal.  (It requires a new porting define, SYS_SIGLIST, which if defined should point to a list of text descriptions of the signals available.  See PORTING.)  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
"*) WIN32: chdir() doesn't make sense in a multithreaded environment like WIN32.  Before, Win32 CGI's could have had sporadic failures if a chdir call from one thread was made between another chdir call and a spawn in another thread.  So, for now don't chdir for CGI scripts in WIN32.  The current CGI ""spec"" is unclear as to whether it's necessary.  Long-term fix is to either serialize the chdir/spawn combo or use WIN32 native calls to spawn a process.  This temp fix was necessary to remove this as a showstopper for 1.3's release. [Brian Behlendorf]"	
----------------------------
*) Cleanup the suEXEC support in APACI and make it more safe: 1. Add big fat hint in INSTALL about risks and to read the htdocs/manual/suexec.html document before using the suexec-related configure options. 2. Make sure the user has at least provided one --suexec-xxxx option (specifies suEXEC parameters) in addition to --enable-suexec option. If only --enable-suexec is given APACI stops with a hint to INSTALL and htdocs/manual/suexec.html documents. 3. Provide two additional --suexec-xxxx options to make the suEXEC configuration complete (especially for package maintainers who else had to patch the source tree) by providing ways to configure minimal UID/GID and safe PATH, too. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Cleanup of the `configure --shadow' process: - make sure the configure script creates its temporary files in the shadow tree to avoid conflicts with parallel configure runs - removed unnecessary option ""-r"" from ""rm"" call for Makefiles - make sure the configure scripts creates the shadow-wrapper Makefile only when no shadow trees already exists - make sure ""make distclean"" removes the shadow-wrapper Makefile but only when no more shadow trees exists - overhauled mkshadow.sh script: now its more IFS-safe and approx. twice as fast (in the past it needed 70sec, now it runs just 38sec) - make sure CVS does not complain about the created files Makefille.<gnutriple> and directories src.<gnutriple> [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
"*) Added the ap_add_version_component() API routine and the AddVersionPlatform core directive.  The first allows modules to declare themselves in the Server response header field value, augmenting the SERVER_SUBVERSION define in the Configuration file with run-time settings (more useful in a loadable-module environment). AddVersionPlatform inserts a comment such as ""(UNIX)"" or ""(Win32)"" into the server version string.  [Ken Coar] PR#2056"	
----------------------------
*) Add a note to httpd.conf-dist that apache will on some systems fail to start when the Group # is set to a negative or large positive value. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Make sure the module execution order is correct even when some modules are loaded under runtime (`LoadModule') via the DSO mechanism: 1. The list of loaded modules is now a dynamically allocated one and not the original statically list from modules.c 2. The loaded modules are now correctly setup by LoadModule for later use by the AddModule command. 3. When the DSO mechanism for modules is used APACI's `install' target now enables all created `LoadModule' lines per default because this is both already expected by the user _and_ needed to avoid confusion with the next point and reduces the Makefile.tmpl complexity 4. When the DSO mechanism for modules is used, APACI's `install' target now additionally makes sure the module list is reconstructed via a complete `ClearModuleList+AddModule...' entry. 5. The support tool `apxs' now also makes sure an AddModule command is added in addition to the LoadModule command. 6. The modules.c generation was extended to now contain two comments to make sure no one is confused by the confusing terminology of loading/linking (we use load=link+load & link=activate instead of the obvious load=activate & link=link :-( ) This way now there is no longer a difference under execution time between statically and dynamically linked modules. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Add a comment to mod_example.c showing the format of a FLAG command handler.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Makes mod_rewrite, mod_log_config, mod_status and the ServerSignature feature compatible with 'UseCanonicalName off' by changing r->server->server_hostname to ap_get_server_name().  And I changed some functions which use r->server->port to use ap_get_server_port() instead, because if there's no Port directive in the config r->server->port is 0. [Lars Eilebrecht]	
----------------------------
*) get/set_module_config are trivial enough to be better off inline.  Worth 1.5% performance boost. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) [BS2000 security] BS2000 needs an extra authentication to initialize the task environment to the unprivileged User id. Otherwise CGI scripts would have a way to gain super user access. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Fix to mod_alias: translate_alias_redir is dealing with a URI, not a filename, so the check for drive letters for win32 and emx is not necessary. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: Various porting changes to support AIX 3.2, 4.1.5, 4.2 and 4.3. Additionally the checks for finding the vendor DSO library were moved from mod_so.c to Configure because first it needs $PLAT etc. and second mod_so already uses an abstraction layer and does not fiddle with the vendor functions itself. [Jens-Uwe Mager, Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Suppress ""error(0)"" messages for ap_log_error() when the APLOG_NOERRNO is unset (as it is in situations like timeouts) where it is unclear whether errno is set or not.  [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Just having APACI's localstatedir is too general and not enough for most of the systems. 1.3b6 again required manual APACI patches by package maintainers from Red Hat and FreeBSD because for their filesystem layout a little bit more flexibility in configuring the paths is needed. Hence we provide three additional configure options (--runtimedir, --logfiledir, --proxycachedir) which now can be used for more granular adjustments if --localstatedir is not enough to fit the particular needs. As a nice side-effect this reduces some subdir fiddling in configure+Makefile.tmpl. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Make the install root for ""make install"" in APACI's Makefile overrideable by package authors.  This way we are even more friendly to package maintainers (especially Debian and Red Hat) who build for the real prefix via ""configure --prefix=/<real>"" but use a different local prefix via ""make root=/tmp/apache install"" for rolling the package without bristling the target location on their system. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) Workaround sed limitations in APACI's configure script by now substituting in chunks of 50 commands (because for instance HPUX's vendor sed has a limit of max. 98 commands) [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2136	
----------------------------
*) Workaround braindead AWK's when generating ap_config.h: The split() and substr() functions cannot be nested under vendor AWK from Solaris 2.6. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2139	
----------------------------
*) Various bugfixes and cleanups for the APACI configure script: o fix IFS handling for _nested_ situation o fix Perl interpreter search: take first one found instead of last one o fix DSO consistency check o print error messages to stderr instead of stdout o add install-quiet for --shadow situation to Makefile stub o reduce complexity by avoiding sed-hacks for rule and module list loops [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fix the path to the ScoreBoardFile in the install-config target, too. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2105	
----------------------------
"*) Let ""configure"" clear out the users parameters (provided as shell variables) to avoid side-effects in ""src/Configure"" when the user exported them (which is not needed, but some users do it). [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2101"	
----------------------------
*) Provide backward compatibility from some old src/Configuration.tmpl parameter names to the canonical Autoconf-style shell variable names. For instance CFLAGS vs. EXTRA_CFLAGS. The EXTRA_xxx variants are accepted now but a hint message is displayed. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Make sure that ""make install"" doesn't overwrite the DocumentRoot and CGI scripts from an existing Apache installation. [Ralf S. Engelschall, Jim Jagielski] PR#2084"	
----------------------------
"*) Make `configure --compat' more ""compatible"" by first let the libexecdir default to EPREFIX/libexec instead of EPREFIX/bin and second by making sure the ""avoid-bristling-suffix"" /apache is not appended to sysconfdir, datadir, localstatedir and includedir when --compat is used. [Ralf S. Engelschall, Lars Eilebrecht]"	
----------------------------
*) Fix the path to the MimeMagicFile in the install-config target, too. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#2089	
----------------------------
*) If you start apache with the -S command line option it will dump out the parsed vhost settings.  This is useful for folks trying to figure out what is wrong with their vhost configuration. (Other dumps may be added in the future.) [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Because /usr/local/apache is the default prefix the ``configure --compat'' option no longer has to set prefix, again. This way the --compat option honors a leading --prefix option. [Lars Eilebrecht]	
----------------------------
"*) PORT: Make sure some AWK's don't fail in src/Configure with ""string too long"" errors when generating the MODULES entry for src/Makefile [Ben Hyde, Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) Make sure src/Configure doesn't complain about the old directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/ when APACI is used.  [Lars Eilebrecht] Changes with Apache 1.3b6	
----------------------------
"*) ++++ THE BIG SYMBOL RENAMING ++++ To avoid symbol clashes with third-party code compiled into the server, we globally applied the prefix ""ap_"" to the following classes of functions: - Apache provided general functions (e.g., ap_cpystrn) - Public API functions (e.g., palloc, bgets) - Private functions which we can't make static (because of cross-object usage) but should be (e.g., new_connection) For backward source compatibility a new header file named compat.h was created which provides defines for the old symbol names and can be used by third-party module authors. [The Apache Group]"	
----------------------------
*) Added dynamic shared object (DSO) support for SVR4-derivates: The problem under SVR4 is that there is no command flag to force the linker to export the global symbols of the httpd executable therewith they are available to the DSO's. Instead of problematic hacks like creating a dummy.so file (containing dummy references to all global symbols) the httpd binary is linked against, we use a clean trick stolen from Perl 5: Placing the Apache core code itself into a DSO library named libhttpd.so. This way the global symbols _HAVE_ to be exported and thus are available to any manually loaded DSO's under runtime. To reduce the impact to the user to null we go even further and create a stub httpd executable which automatically keeps track of the DSO library loading itself and thus hides the complete mechanism from the user. Although the generation of this DSO library is automatically triggered for platforms which essentially need it (mostly all SVR4-derivates) it can be also enabled manually via the Rule SHARED_CORE. This can be interesting in the future where we perhaps exploit this libhttpd.so mechanism for providing nifty features like graceful upgrades, or whatever. [Ralf S. Engelschall, Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
"*) Add ""distclean"" target to src/-Makefiles to provide ""make distclean"" also inside the src subtree (i.e. for non-APACI users). Following GNU Makefile conventions while ""clean"" removes only stuff created by ""all"" targets, ""distclean"" additionally removes the stuff from the configuration process. This way ""make distclean"" (hence the name) provides a fresh source tree as it was for distribution. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) Allow top-level (APACI) Makefile to break on build errors the same way the src/ subtree Makefiles breaks on them by replacing the initial APACI sed-subdir-display-kludge with a more clean variable-passing-solution: variable SDP can optionally hold the subdir prefix which is consistently used for displaying the subdir movement. This way even the top-level Makefile can stop correctly on errors as the user expects. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed ordering of argument checks for RewriteBase directive. [Todd Eigenschink <eigenstr mixi.net>] PR#2045	
----------------------------
*) Add documentation file and src/Configuration.tmpl entry for the experimental mod_mmap_static module. Because although it is and marked as an experimental one it is distributed and thus should be documented and prepared for configuration the same way as all others modules. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Now src/Configure uses a fallback strategy for the shared object support on platforms where no explicit information is available: If a Perl installation exists we ask it about its shared object support and if it's the dlopen-style one we shamelessly guess the compiler and linker flags for creating shared objects from Perls knowledge. Of course, the user is warning about what we are doing and informed that he should send us the guessed flags when they work. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Modify the log directives in httpd.conf-dist files to use CustomLog so that users have examples of how CustomLog can be used. [Lars Eilebrecht]	
----------------------------
"*) Add the new Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI) for the top-level of the Apache distribution tree.  Until Apache 1.3 there was no real out-of-the-box batch-capable build and installation procedure for the complete Apache package. This is now provided by a top-level ""configure"" script and a corresponding top-level ""Makefile.tmpl"" file.  The goal is to provide a GNU Autoconf-style frontend which is capable to both drive the old src/Configure stuff in batch and additionally installs the package with a GNU-conforming directory layout. Any options from the old configuration scheme are available plus a lot of new options for flexibly customizing Apache. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) BUG: Configure was using TCC and CC inconsistently. Make sure Configure knows which CC we are using. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
"*) ""Options +Includes"" wasn't correctly merged if ""+IncludesNoExec"" was defined in a parent directory. [Lars Eilebrecht]"	
----------------------------
"*) SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ are now reset to SIG_DFL at boot-time.  This is necessary on at least Solaris where the /etc/rc?.d scripts are run with these signals ignored, and ""SIG_IGN"" settings are maintained across exec(). [Rein Tollevik <reint sys.sol.no>] PR#2009"	
----------------------------
*) Fix the check for symbolic links in ``RewriteCond ... -l'': stat() was used instead of lstat() and thus this flag didn't work as expected. [Rein Tollevik <reint sys.sol.no>] PR#2010	
----------------------------
*) The default for HostnameLookups was changed to Off, but there was a problem and it wasn't taking effect. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: Clean up undefined signals on some platforms (SCO, BeOS). [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) After a SIGHUP the listening sockets in the parent weren't properly marked for closure on fork(). [Jürgen Keil <jk tools.de>] PR#2000	
----------------------------
*) Reanimated the (still undocumented) proxy receive buffer size directive: Renamed from ReceiveBufferSize to ProxyReceiveBufferSize because the old name was really too generic, added documentation for this directive to the mod_proxy.html and corrected the hyperlink to it in the new_features_1.3.html document.  [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1348	
----------------------------
*) Fix a bug in the src/helpers/fp2rp script and make it a little bit faster [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Make Configure die when you give it an unknown command switch. [Ben Hyde]	
----------------------------
*) Add five new and fresh manpages for the support programs: dbmmanage.1, suexec.8, htdigest.1, rotatelogs.8 and logresolve.8.  Now all up-to-date and per default compiled support programs have manual pages - just to document our stuff a little bit more and to be able to do really Unix-like installations ;-) [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Major cleanups to the Configure script to make it and its generated Makefiles again readable and maintainable: add SRCDIR option, removed INCLUDES_DEPTH[0-2] kludge, cleanup of TARGET option, cleanup of generated sections, consequently added Makefile headers with inheritance information, added subdir movement messages for easier following where the build process currently stays (more verbose then standard Make, less verbose than GNU make), same style to comments in the Configure script, added Apache license header, fixed a few bugs, etc. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) mod_proxy was not clearing the Proxy-Connection header from requests; now it does.  This did not violate any spec, however causes poor interactions when you are talking to remote proxies. [Marc Slemko] PR#1741	
----------------------------
*) Performance tweak to mod_log_config.  [Dmitry Khrustalev]	
----------------------------
"*) Clean up some undocumented behavior of mod_setenvif related to ""merging"" two SetEnvIf directives when they match the same header and regex.  Document that mod_setenvif will perform comparisons in the order they appear in the config file.  Optimize mod_setenvif by doing more work at config time rather than at runtime. [Dean Gaudet]"	
----------------------------
*) src/include/ap_config.h now wraps it's #define's with #ifndef/#endif's to allow for modules to overrule them and to reduce redefinition warnings [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Added support for building shared objects even for library-style modules (which are built from more than one object file). This now provides the ability to build mod_proxy as a shared object module. Additionally modules like mod_example are now also supported for shared object building because the generated Makefiles now no longer assume there is at least one statically linked module. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Prior to the existence of mod_setenv it was necessary to tweak the TZ environment variable in the apache core.  But that tweaking interferes with mod_setenv.  So don't tweak if the user has specified an explicit TZ variable.  [Jay Soffian <jay cimedia.com>] PR#1888	
----------------------------
*) Various improvements to the configuration and build support for compiling modules as shared objects. Especially Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4.1, IRIX and OSF1 support with GCC and vendor compilers was added.  This way shared object support is now provided out-of-the-box for FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, SunOS, IRIX and OSF1. In short: On all major platforms! [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix one more special locking problem for RewriteMap programs in mod_rewrite: According to the documentation of flock(), ""Locks are on files, not file descriptors.  That is, file descriptors duplicated through dup(2) or fork(2) do not result in multiple instances of a lock, but rather multiple references to a single lock. If a process holding a lock on a file forks and the child explicitly unlocks the file, the parent will lose its lock."". To overcome this we have to make sure the RewriteLock file is opened _AFTER_ the childs were spawned which is now the case by opening it in the child_init instead of the module_init API hook. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1029"	
----------------------------
*) Change to Location and LocationMatch semantics.  LocationMatch no longer lets a single slash match multiple adjacent slashes in the URL.  This change is for consistency with RewriteRule and AliasMatch.  Multiple slashes have meaning in URLs that they do not have in (some) filesystems.  Location on the other hand can be considered a shorthand for a more complicated regex, and it does match multiple slashes with a single slash -- which is also consistent with the Alias directive. [Dean Gaudet] related PR#1440	
----------------------------
*) The Configure script now generates src/include/ap_config.h which contains the set of defines used when Apache is compiled on a platform. This file can then be included by external modules before including any Apache header files in case they are being built separately from Apache.  Along with this change, a couple of minor changes were made to make Apache's #defines coexist peacefully with any autoconf defines an external module might have. [Rasmus Lerdorf]	
----------------------------
*) Fix mod_rewrite for the ugly API case where <VirtualHost> sections exist but without any RewriteXXXXX directives. Here mod_rewrite is given no chance by the API to initialize its per-server configuration and thus receives the wrong one from the main server. This is now avoided by remembering the server together with the config structure while configuring and later assuming there is no config when we see a difference between the remembered server and the one calling us. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1790	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the DBM RewriteMap support for mod_rewrite: First the support now is automatically disabled under configure time when the dbm_xxx functions are not available. Second, two heavy source code errors in the DBM support code were fixed.  This makes DBM RewriteMap's usable again after a long time of brokenness. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1696	
----------------------------
"*) Now all configuration files support Unix-style line-continuation via the trailing backslash (""\"") character. This enables us to write down complex or just very long directives in a more readable way.  The backslash character has to be really the last character before the newline and it has not been prefixed by another (escaping) backslash. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) When using ProxyPass the ?querystring was not passed correctly. [Joel Truher <truher wired.com>]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT has proven unreliable depending on the rev of Solaris and what mixture of modules are in use.  So it has been disabled, and Solaris is back to using USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.  Users may experiment with USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT at their own risk, it may speed up static content only servers.  Or it may fail unpredictably. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1779, 1854, 1904	
----------------------------
"*) API: Rewrite of absoluteURI handling, and in particular how absoluteURIs match vhosts.  Unless a request is a proxy request, a ""http://host"" url is treated as if a similar ""Host:"" header had been supplied.  This change was made to support future HTTP/1.x protocols which may require clients to send absoluteURIs for all requests. In order to achieve this change subtle changes were made to the API.  In a request_rec, r->hostlen has been removed.  r->unparsed_uri now exists so that the unmodified uri can be retrieved easily.  r->proxyreq is not set by the core, modules must set it during the post_read_request or translate_names phase. Plus changes to the virtualhost test suite for absoluteURI testing. This fixes several bugs with the proxy proxying requests to vhosts managed by the same httpd. [Dean Gaudet]"

*) Reduce memory usage, and speed up ServerAlias support.  As a side-effect users can list multiple ServerAlias directives and they're all considered. [Chia-liang Kao <clkao cirx.org>] PR#1531	
----------------------------
*) Add the `%a' construct to LogFormat and CustomLog to log the client IP address. [Todd Eigenschink <eigenstr mixi.net>] PR#1885	
----------------------------
"*) API: A new source module main/util_uri.c; It contains a routine parse_uri_components() and friends which breaks a URI into its component parts.  These parts are stored in a uri_components structure called parsed_uri within each request_rec, and are available to all modules. Additionally, an unparse routine is supplied which re-assembles the URI components back to an URI, optionally hiding the username:password@ part from ftp proxy requests, and other useful routines.  Within the structure, you find on a ready-for-use basis: scheme;     /* scheme (""http""/""ftp""/...) */ hostinfo;   /* combined [user[:password]@]host[:port] */ user;       /* user name, as in http://user:passwd@host:port/ */ password;   /* password, as in http://user:passwd@host:port/ */ hostname;   /* hostname from URI (or from Host: header) */ port_str;   /* port string (integer representation is in ""port"") */ path;       /* the request path (or ""/"" if only scheme://host was given) */ query;      /* Everything after a '?' in the path, if present */ fragment;   /* Trailing ""#fragment"" string, if present */ This is meant to serve as the platform for *BIG* savings in code complexity for the proxy module (and maybe the vhost logic). [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Make all possible meta-construct expansions ($N, %N, %{NAME} and ${map:key}) available for all location where a string is created in mod_rewrite rewriting rulesets: 1st arg of RewriteCond, 2nd arg of RewriteRule and for the [E=NAME:STRING] flag of RewriteRule. This way the possible expansions are consequently usable at all string creation locations. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Fix initialization of RewriteLogLevel (default now is 0 as documented and not 1) and the per-virtual-server merging of directives. Now all directives except `RewriteEngine' and `RewriteOption' are either completely overridden (default) or completely inherited (when `RewriteOptions inherit') is used. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1325	
----------------------------
*) Fix `RewriteMap' program lookup in situations where such maps are defined but disabled (`RewriteEngine off') in per-server context. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1431	
----------------------------
*) Fix bug introduced in 1.3b4-dev, config with no Port setting would cause server to bind to port 0 rather than 80.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Fix long-standing problem with RewriteMap _programs_ under Unix derivates (like SunOS and FreeBSD) which don't accept the locking of pipes directly.  A new directive RewriteLock is introduced which can be used to setup a separate locking file which then is used for synchronization. [Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#1029	
----------------------------
"*) WIN32: The server root is obtained from the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Apache Group\Apache\<version> (version is currently ""1.3 beta""), unless overridden by the -d command line flag. The value is stored by running ""apache -i -d serverroot"". [Paul Sutton]"	
----------------------------
*) Now mod_rewrite no longer makes problematic assumptions on the characters a username can contain when trying to expand it via /etc/passwd. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) The mod_setenvif BrowserMatch backwards compatibility command did not work properly with spaces in the regex.  [Ronald Tschalaer] PR#1825	
----------------------------
*) Add new RewriteMap types: First, `rnd' which is equivalent to the `txt' type but with a special post-processing for the looked-up value: It parses it into alternatives according to `|' chars and then only one particular alternative is chosen randomly (this is an essential functionality needed for balancing between backend-servers when using Apache as a Reverse Proxy.  The looked up value here is a list of servers). Second, `int' with the built-in maps named `tolower' and `toupper' which can be used to map URL parts to a fixed case (this is an essential feature to fix the case of server names when doing mass virtual-hosting with the help of mod_rewrite instead of using <VirtualHost> sections). [Ralf S. Engelschall, parts based on code from Jay Soffian <jay cimedia.com>] PR#1631	
----------------------------
*) Add a new directive to mod_proxy similar to ProxyPass: `ProxyPassReverse'. This directive lets Apache adjust the URL in Location-headers on HTTP redirect responses sent by the remote server. This way the virtually mapped area is no longer left on redirects and thus by-passed which is especially essential when running Apache as a reverse proxy. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Use SA_RESETHAND or SA_ONESHOT when installing the coredump handlers. In particular the handlers could trigger themselves into an infinite loop if RLimitMem was used with a small amount of memory -- too small for the signal stack frame to be set up.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Fix multiple UserDir problem introduced during 1.3b4-dev. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1850	
----------------------------
*) Linux 2.0 and above implement RLIMIT_AS, RLIMIT_DATA has almost no effect.  Work around it by using RLIMIT_AS for the RLimitMEM directive.  [Enrik Berkhan <enrik inka.de>] PR#1816	
----------------------------
*) Previously Apache would permit </Files> to end <FilesMatch> (and similary for Location and Directory), now this is diagnosed as an error.  Improve error messages for mismatched sections (<Files>, <FilesMatch>, <Directory>, <DirectoryMatch>, ...). [Dean Gaudet, Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) <Files> is not permitted within <Location> (because of the semantic ordering).  [Dean Gaudet] PR#379	
----------------------------
*) <Files> with wildcards was broken by the change in wildcard semantics (* does not match /).  To fix this, <Files> now apply only to the basename of the request filename.  This fixes some other inconsistencies in <Files> semantics (such as <Files a*b> not working).  [Dean Gaudet] PR#1817	
----------------------------
"*) SECURITY: ""UserDir /abspath"" without a * in the path would allow remote users to access ""/~.."" and bypass access restrictions (but note /~../.. was handled properly). [Lauri Jesmin <jesmin ut.ee>] PR#1701"	
----------------------------
*) Preserve the content encoding given by the AddEncoding directive when the client doesn't otherwise specify an encoding. [Ronald Tschalaer <Ronald.Tschalaer psi.ch>]	
----------------------------
*) All BrowserMatch directives mentioned in htdocs/manual/known_client_problems.html are in the default configuration files.  [Lars Eilebrecht]	
----------------------------
*) HTTP/1.1 requires x-gzip and gzip encodings be treated equivalent, similarly for x-compress and compress.  Apache now ignores a leading x- when comparing encodings.  It also preserves the encoding the client requests (for example if it requests x-gzip, then Apache will respond with x-gzip in the Content-Encoding header). [Ronald Tschalaer <Ronald.Tschalaer psi.ch>] PR#1772	
----------------------------
*) Added mod_so module to support dynamic loading of modules on Unix (like mod_dld for Win32). This replaces mod_dld.c. Use SharedModule instead of AddModule in Configuration to build shared modules [Sameer Parekh, Paul Sutton]	
----------------------------
*) API: Generalize default_port manipulations to make support of different protocols easier. [Ben Laurie, Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) There are many cases where users do not want Apache to form self-referential urls using the ""canonical"" ServerName and Port. The new UseCanonicalName directive (default on), if set to off will cause Apache to use the client-supplied hostname and port. API: Part of this change required a change to the construct_url() prototype; and the addition of get_server_name() and get_server_port(). [Michael Douglass <mikedoug texas.net>, Dean Gaudet] PR#315, 459, 485, 1433"	
----------------------------
*) Yet another rearrangement of the source tree.. now all the common header files are in the src/include directory.  The -Imain -Iap references in Makefiles have been changed to the simpler -Iinclude instead.  In addition to simplifying the build a little bit, this also makes it clear when a module is referencing something in a other than kosher manner (e.g., the proxy including mod_mime.h). Module-private header files (the proxy, mod_mime, the regex library, and mod_rewrite) have not been moved to src/include; nor have the OS-abstraction files.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Options and AllowOverride weren't properly merging in the main server setting inside vhosts (only an issue when you have no <Directory> or other section containing an Options that affects a request).  Options +foo or -foo in the main_server wouldn't affect the main_server's lookup defaults.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) mod_unique_id was erroneously generating a second unique id when an internal redirect occured.  Such redirects occur, for example, when processing a DirectoryIndex match.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
"*) More mod_mime_magic cleanup:  fewer syscalls; should handle ""files"" which don't exist on disk more gracefully; handles vhosts properly. Update documentation to reflect the code -- if there's no MimeMagicFile directive then the module is not enabled. [Dean Gaudet]"	
----------------------------
"*) PORT: Some older *nix dialects cannot automatically start scripts which begin with a #! interpreter line (the shell starts the scripts appropriately on these platforms). Apache now supports starting of ""hashbang-scripts"" when the NEED_HASHBANG_EMUL define is set. [Martin Kraemer, with code from Peter Wemm <peter zeus.dialix.oz.au> taken from tcsh]"	
----------------------------
*) For clarity the following compile time definition was changed: SAFE_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT  ->   SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT Also, for example, HAVE_MMAP would mean to use mmap() scoreboards and not be a general notice that the OS has mmap(). Now the HAVE_MMAP/SHMGET #defines strictly are informational that the OS has that method of shared memory; the type to use for the scoreboard is a seperate #define (USE_MMAP_SCOREBOARD and USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD). This allows outside modules to determine if shared memory is available and allows Apache to determine the best method to use for the scoreboard. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: A/UX can handle single-listen accepts without mutex locking, so we add SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) When die() happens we need to eat any request body if one exists. Otherwise we can't continue with a keepalive session.  This shows up as a POST problem with MSIE 4.0, typically against pages which are authenticated.  [Roy Fielding] PR#1399	
----------------------------
*) Fix Y2K problem with date printing in suexec log. [Paul Eggert <eggert twinsun.com>] PR#1343	
----------------------------
*) suexec errors now include the errno/description.  [Marc Slemko] PR#1543	
----------------------------
*) PORT: OSF/1 now uses USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to solve PR#467. The choice of flock vs. fcntl was made based on timings which showed that even on non-NFS, non-exported filesystems fcntl() was an order of magnitude slower.  It also uses SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT so that single socket users will see no difference. [Dean Gaudet] PR#467	
----------------------------
*) mod_rewrite's RewriteLog should behave like mod_log_config, it shouldn't force hostname lookups.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#1684	
----------------------------
*) For maximum portability, the environment passed to CGIs should only contain variables whose names match the regex /[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/.  This is now enforced by stamping underscores over any character outside the regex.  This affects HTTP_* variables, in a way that should be backward compatible for all the standard headers; and affects variables set with SetEnv/BrowserMatch and similar directives. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
"*) new -C and -c command line arguments usage: -C ""directive"" : process directive before reading config files -c ""directive"" : process directive after reading config files example: httpd -C ""PerlModule Apache::httpd_conf"" [Doug MacEachern, Martin Kraemer]"

----------------------------
*) Give a more informative error when no AuthType is set. [Lars Eilebrecht]	
----------------------------
*) Directives owned by http_core can now use the new check_cmd_context() routine to ensure that they're not being used within a container (e.g., <Directory>) where they're invalid.  [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) mod_autoindex wasn't displaying the ReadmeName file at the bottom unless it was also doing FancyIndexes, but it displayed the HeaderName file at the top under all circumstances.  It now shows the ReadmeName file for simple indices, too, as it should. [Ken Coar] PR#1373	
----------------------------
*) Complete rewrite ;-) of mod_rewrite's URL rewriting engine: Now the rewriting engine (the heart of mod_rewrite) is organized more straight-forward, first time well documented and reduced to the really essential parts. All redundant cases were stripped off and processing now is the same for both per-server and per-directory context with only a minimum difference (the prefix stripping in per-dir context). As a side-effect some subtle restrictions and two recently discovered problems are gone: Wrong escaping of QUERY_STRING on redirects in per-directory context and restrictions on the substitution URL on redirects. Additionally some minor source cleanups were done. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Lars Eilebrecht wrote a whole new set of Apache Vhost Internals documentation, examples, explanations and caveats. They live in a new subdirectory htdocs/manual/vhost/. [Lars Eilebrecht <sfx unix-ag.org>]	
----------------------------
*) If ap_slack fails to allocate above the low slack line it's a good indication that further problems will occur; it's a better indication than many external libraries give us when we actually run out of descriptors.  So report it to the user once per restart. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1181	
----------------------------
"*) Add a ""SuppressColumnSorting"" option to the IndexOptions list, which will keep the column heading from being links for sorting the display.  [Ken Coar, suggested by Brian Tiemann <btman pacific.net>] PR #1261"

*) Preserve handler value on ProxyPass'ed requests by not calling find_types on a proxy'd request; fixes problems where some ProxyPass'ed URLs weren't actually passed to the proxy. [Lars Eilebrecht] PR#870	
----------------------------
*) Fix problem with USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT not working properly. Each child needs to open the lockfile instead of using the passed file-descriptor from the parent. [Jim Jagielski] PR#1056	
----------------------------
*) Default to USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT on HPUX to properly handle multiple Listen directives.  [Marc Slemko] PR#872

"*) Invent new structure and associated methods to handle config file reading. Add ""custom"" hook to use config file cfg_getline() on something which is not a FILE*  [Martin Kraemer]"	
----------------------------
*) Various improvements in detecting config file errors (missing closing directives for <Directory>, <Files> etc. blocks, prohibiting global server settings in <VirtualHost> blocks, flagging unhandled multiple arguments to <Directory>, <Files> etc.) [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Add support to suexec wrapper program for mod_unique_id's UNIQUE_ID variable to provide this one to suexec'd CGIs, too. [M.D.Parker <mdpc netcom.com>] PR#1284	
----------------------------
"*) New support tool: src/support/split-logfile, a sample Perl script which splits up a combined access log into separate files based on the name of the virtual host (listed first in the log records by ""%v""). [Ken Coar] Changes with Apache 1.3b2 (there is no 1.3b1)"	
----------------------------
*) Configure uses a sh trap and didn't set its exitcode properly. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1159	
----------------------------
*) Yet another vhost revamp.  Add the NameVirtualHost directive which explicitly lists the ip:port pairs that are to be used for name-vhosts. From a given ip:port, regardless what the Host: header is, you can only reach the vhosts defined on that ip:port.  The precedence of vhosts was reversed to match other precedences in the config -- the earlier vhosts override the later vhosts.  All vhost matching was moved into http_vhost.[ch].  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) CoreDumpDirectory directive directs where the core file is written when a SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGABORT or SIGABRT are received.  [Marc Slemko, Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) When booting, apache will now detach itself from stdin, stdout, and stderr.  stderr will not be detached until after the config files have been read so you will be able to see initial error messages.  After that all errors are logged in the error_log. This makes it more convenient to start apache via rsh, ssh, or crontabs.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#523	
----------------------------
*) suexec.c wouldn't build without -DLOG_EXEC. [Jason A. Dour]	
----------------------------
*) mod_autoindex improperly counted &escapes; as more than one character in the description.  It also improperly truncated descriptions that were exactly the maximum length. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
"*) RedirectMatch was not properly escaping the result (PR#1155).  Also ""RedirectMatch /advertiser/(.*) $1"" is now permitted. [Dean Gaudet]"	
----------------------------
*) mod_include now uses symbolic names to check for request success and return HTTP errors, and correctly handles all types of redirections (previously it only did temporary redirect correctly). [Ken Coar, Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
"*) mod_userdir was modifying r->finfo in cases where it wasn't setting r->filename.  Since those two are meant to be in sync with each other this is a bug.  [""Paul B. Henson"" <henson intranet.csupomona.edu>]"	
----------------------------
*) Inetd mode (which is buggy) uses timeouts without having setup the jmpbuffer. [Dean Gaudet] PR#1064	
----------------------------
*) If BUFFERED_LOGS is defined then mod_log_config will do atomic buffered writes -- that is, it will buffer up to PIPE_BUF (i.e. 4k) bytes before writing, but it will never split a log entry across a buffer boundary.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
"*) Changes to mod_log_config to allow naming of format strings. Format nicknames are defined with ""LogFormat fmt nickname"", and can be used with ""LogFormat nickname"" and ""CustomLog logtarget nickname"". [Ken Coar]"	
----------------------------
*) *Really* disable all mod_rewrite operations if the engine is off. Some things (like RewriteMaps) were checked/performed even if they weren't supposed to be.  [Ken Coar] PR #991	
----------------------------
*) Implement a new timer scheme which eliminates the need to call alarm() all the time.  Instead a counter in the scoreboard for each child is used to show when the child has made forward progress.  The parent samples this counter every scoreboard maintenance cycle, and issues SIGALRM if no progress has been made in the timeout period.  This reduces the static request best-case syscall count to 22 from 29.  This scheme is only used by systems with memory-based scoreboards.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) The proxy now properly handles CONNECT requests which are sent to proxy servers when using ProxyRemote.  [Marc Slemko] PR#1024	
----------------------------
"*) A script called apachectl has been added to the support directory.  This script allows you to do things such as ""apachectl start"" and ""apachectl restart"" from the command line.  [Marc Slemko]"	
----------------------------
*) Removal of mod_auth_msql.c from the distribution. There are many other options for databases today. Rather than offer one option, offer none at this time. mod_auth_msql and other SQL database authentication modules can be found at the Apache Module Registry. http://modules.apache.org/ It would be nice to offer a generic mod_auth_sql option in the near future.	
----------------------------
*) Configure no longer accepts the -make option, since it creates Makefile on the fly based on Makefile.tmpl and Configuration.	
----------------------------
*) Add aplog_error() providing a mechanism to define levels of verbosity to the server error logging. This addition also provides the ability to log errors using syslogd. Error logging is configurable on a per-server basis using the LogLevel directive. Conversion of log_*() in progress. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) Add the server version (SERVER_VERSION macro) to the ""server configured and running"" entry in the error_log.  Also build an object file at link-time that contains the current time (SERVER_BUILT global const char[]), and include that in the message.  [Ken Coar]"	
----------------------------
*) If no TransferLog is given explicitly, decline to log.  This supports coexistence with other logging modules, such as the custom one that UUNET uses. [David J. MacKenzie]	
----------------------------
*) Change mod_cern_meta to be configurable on a per-directory basis. [David J. MacKenzie]	
----------------------------
*) Add 'Include' directive to allow inclusion of configuration files within configuration files. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) API: Added post_read_request API phase which is run right after reading the request from a client, or right after an internal redirect.  It is useful for modules setting environment variables that depend only on the headers/contents of the request.  It does not run during subrequests because subrequests inherit pretty much everything from the main request. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: Apache has need for mutexes to serialize its children around accept.  In prior versions either fcntl file locking or flock file locking were used.  The method is chosen by the definition of USE_xxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT in conf.h.  xxx is FCNTL for fcntl(), and FLOCK for flock().  New options have been added: - SYSVSEM to use System V style semaphores - PTHREAD to use POSIX threads (appears to work on Solaris only) - USLOCK to use IRIX uslock Based on timing various techniques, the following changes were made to the defaults: - Linux 2.x uses flock instead of fcntl - Solaris 2.x uses pthreads - IRIX uses SysV semaphores -- however multiprocessor IRIX boxes work far faster if you -DUSE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT [Dean Gaudet, Pierre-Yves Kerembellec <Pierre-Yves.Kerembellec vtcom.fr>, Martijn Koster <m.koster pobox.com>]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: The semantics of accept/select make it very desirable to use mutexes to serialize accept when multiple Listens are in use.  But in the case where only a single socket is open it is sometimes redundant to serialize accept().  Not all unixes do a good job with potentially dozens of children blocked on accept() on the same socket.  It's now possible to define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT and the server will avoid serialization when listening on only one socket, and use serialization when listening on multiple sockets. [Dean Gaudet] PR#467	
----------------------------
*) Configure changes: TestLib replaced by TestCompile, which has some additional capability (such as doing a sanity check of the compiler and flags selected); the version of Solaris is now available via the #define value of SOLARIS2; IRIX n32bit libs now supported and selectable by new Configuration Rule: IRIXN32; We no longer default to -O2 optimization.  [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Updated Configure: Configuration now uses AddModule to specify module source or binary file location, relative to src directory. Modules can be dropped into modules/extra, or in their own directory, and modules can come with a Makefile or Configure can create one.  Modules can add compiler or library information to generated Makefiles. [Paul Sutton]	
----------------------------
*) mod_browser has been removed, since it's replaced by mod_setenvif. [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
"*) directory_walk optimization to reduce an O(N*M) loop to O(N+M) where N is the number of <Directory> sections, and M is the number of components in the filename of an object. To achieve this optimization the following config changes were made: - Wildcards (* and ?, not the regex forms) in <Directory>s, <Files>s, and <Location>s now treat a slash as a special character.  For example ""/home/*/public_html"" previously would match ""/home/a/andrew/public_html"", now it only matches things like ""/home/bob/public_html"".  This mimics /bin/sh behaviour. - It's possible now to use [] wildcarding in <Directory>, <Files> or <Location>. - Regex <Directory>s are applied after all non-regex <Directory>s. [Dean Gaudet]"	
----------------------------
*) Enhanced and cleaned up the URL rewriting engine of mod_rewrite: First the grouped parts of RewriteRule pattern matches (parenthesis!) can be accessed now via backreferences $1..$9 in RewriteConds test-against strings in addition to RewriteRules subst string. Second the grouped parts of RewriteCond pattern matches (parenthesis!) can be accessed now via backreferences %1..%9 both in following RewriteCond test-against strings and RewriteRules subst string. This provides maximum flexibility through the use of backreferences. Additionally the rewriting engine was cleaned up by putting common code to the new expand_backrefs_inbuffer() function. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) When merging the main server's <Directory> and <Location> sections into a vhost, put the main server's first and the vhost's second.  Otherwise the vhost can't override the main server.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#717	
----------------------------
*) The <Directory> code would merge and re-merge the same section after a match was found, possibly causing problems with some modules. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) ip-based vhosts are stored and queried using a hashing function, which has been shown to improve performance on servers with many ip-vhosts. Some other changes had to be made to accommodate this: - the * address for vhosts now behaves like _default_ - the matching process now is: - match an ip-vhost directly via hash (possibly matches main server) - if that fails, just pretend it matched the main server - if so far only the main server has been matched, perform name-based lookups (ServerName, ServerAlias, ServerPath) *only on name-based vhosts* - if they fail, look for _default_ vhosts [Dean Gaudet, Dave Hankins <dhankins sugarat.net>]	
----------------------------
"*) dbmmanage overhaul: - merge dbmmanage and dbmmanage.new functionality, remove dbmmanage.new - tie() to AnyDBM_File which will use one of DB_File, NDBM_File or GDBM_File (-ldb, -lndbm, -lgdbm) (trying each in that order) - provide better seed for rand - prompt for password as per getpass(3) (turn off echo, read from /dev/tty, etc.) - use ""newstyle"" crypt based on $Config{osname} ($^O) - will not add a user if already in database, use new `update' command instead - added `check' command to check a users' password - added `import' command to convert existing password text-files or dbm files exported with `view' - more descriptive usage, general cleanup, 'use strict' clean, etc. [Doug MacEachern]"	
----------------------------
"*) Enable ``=""""'' for RewriteCond directives to match against the empty string. This is the preferred way instead of ``^$''. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
*) mod_proxy now has a ReceiveBufferSize directive, similar to SendBufferSize, so that the TCP window can be set appropriately for LFNs. [Phillip A. Prindeville]	
----------------------------
*) mod_browser has been replaced by the more general mod_setenvif (courtesy of Paul Sutton).  BrowserMatch* directives are still available, but are now joined by SetEnvIf*, UnSetEnvIf*, and UnSetEnvIfZero directives.  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
"*) ""HostnameLookups double"" forces double-reverse DNS to succeed in order for remote_host to be set (for logging, or for the env var REMOTE_HOST).  The old define MAXIMUM_DNS has been deprecated. [Dean Gaudet]"

"*) mod_access overhaul: - Now understands network/netmask syntax (i.e.  10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0) and cidr syntax (i.e. 10.1.0.0/16).  PR#762 - Critical path was sped up by pre-computing a few things at config time. - The undocumented syntax ""allow user-agents"" was removed, the replacement is ""allow from env=foobar"" combined with mod_browser. - When used with hostnames it now forces a double-reverse lookup no matter what the directory settings are.  This double-reverse doesn't affect any of the other routines that use the remote hostname.  In particular it's still passed to CGIs and the log without the double-reverse check.  Related PR#860.

*) child_main avoids an unneeded call to select() when there is only one listening socket.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) In the event that the server is starved for idle servers it will spawn 1, then 2, then 4, ..., then 32 servers each second, doubling each second.  It'll also give a warning in the errorlog since the most common reason for this is a poor StartServers setting.  The define MAX_SPAWN_RATE can be used to raise/lower the maximum.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
"*) Apache now provides an effectively unbuffered connection for CGI scripts.  This means that data will be sent to the client as soon as the CGI pauses or stops output; previously, Apache would buffer the output up to a fixed buffer size before sending, which could result in the user viewing an empty page until the CGI finished or output a complete buffer.  It is no longer necessary to use an ""nph-"" CGI to get unbuffered output.  Given that most CGIs are written in a language that by default does buffering (e.g. perl) this shouldn't have a detrimental effect on performance. ""nph-"" CGIs, which formerly provided a direct socket to the client without any server post-processing, were not fully compatible with HTTP/1.1 or SSL support.  As such they would have had to implement the transport details, such as encryption or chunking, in order to work properly in certain situations.  Now, the only difference between nph and non-nph scripts is ""non-parsed headers"". [Dean Gaudet, Sameer Parekh, Roy Fielding]"	
----------------------------
*) Added another Configure helper script: TestLib. It determines if a specified library exists.  [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) PORT: QNX doesn't have initgroups() which support/suexec.c uses. [Igor N Kovalenko <infoh mail.wplus.net>]	
----------------------------
"*) ""force-response-1.0"" now only applies to requests which are HTTP/1.0 to begin with.  ""nokeepalive"" now works for HTTP/1.1 clients.  Added ""downgrade-1.0"" which causes Apache to pretend it received a 1.0. [Dean Gaudet] related PR#875"	
----------------------------
*) API: Correct child_init() slot declaration from int to void, to match the init() declaration.  Update mod_example to use the new hook.  [Ken Coar]

*) Added NoProxy directive to avoid using ProxyRemote for selected addresses.  Added ProxyDomain directive to cause unqualified names to be qualified by redirection. [Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer mch.sni.de>]	
----------------------------
"*) Upgraded mod_rewrite from 3.0.6+ to latest officially available version 3.0.9. This upgrade includes: fixed deadlooping on rewriting to same URLs, fixed rewritelog(), fixed forced response code handling on redirects from within .htaccess files, disabled pipe locking under braindead SunOS 4.1.x, allow env variables to be set even on rules with no substitution, bugfixed situations where HostnameLookups is off, made mod_rewrite more thread-safe for NT port and fixed problem when creating an empty query string via ""xxx?"". This update also removes the copyright of Ralf S. Engelschall, i.e. now mod_rewrite no longer has a shared copyright. Instead is is exclusively copyrighted by the Apache Group now. This happened because the author now has gifted mod_rewrite exclusively to the Apache Group and no longer maintains an external version. [Ralf S. Engelschall]"	
----------------------------
"*) API: Added child_init function to module structure.  This is called once per ""heavy-weight process"" before any requests are handled. See http_config.h for more details.  [Dean Gaudet]"

----------------------------
*) IndexOptions SuppressHTMLPreamble now causes the actual HTML of directory indices to start with the contents of the HeaderName file if there is one.  If there isn't one, the behaviour is unchanged. [Ken Coar, Roy Fielding, Andrey A. Chernov]	
----------------------------
*) WIN32: Modules can now be dynamically loaded DLLs using the LoadModule/LoadFile directives. Note that module DLLs must be compiled with the multithreaded DLL version of the runtime library. [Alexei Kosut and Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Automatic indexing removed from mod_dir and placed into mod_autoindex. This allows the admin to completely remove automatic indexing from the server, while still supporting the basic functions of trailing-slash redirects and DirectoryIndex files.  Note that if you're carrying over an old Configuration file and you use directory indexing then you'll want to add: Module autoindex_module    mod_autoindex.o before mod_dir in your Configuration.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) AliasMatch, ScriptAliasMatch and RedirectMatch directives added, giving regex support to mod_alias. <DirectoryMatch>, <LocationMatch> and <FilesMatch> sections added to succeed <DirectoryMatch ~>, etc... [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
"*) The AccessFileName directive can now take more than one filename. [""Lou D. Langholtz"" <ldl usi.utah.edu>]"

*) In configurations using multiple Listen statements it was possible for busy sockets to starve other sockets of service.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Enhance UserDir directive (mod_userdir) to accept a list of usernames for the 'disable' keyword, and add 'enable user...' to selectively *en*able userdirs if they're globally disabled. [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Add a ListenBacklog directive to control the backlog parameter passed to listen().  Also change the default to 511 from 512. [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) Added IconHeight and IconWidth to mod_dir's IndexOptions directive. When used together, these cause mod_dir to emit HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes in the FancyIndexing IMG tags.  [Ken Coar]

*) SECURITY: General mod_include cleanup, including fixing several possible buffer overflows and a possible infinite loop.  This cleanup was done against 1.3 code and then backported to 1.2, the result is a large difference (due to indentation cleanup in 1.3 code). Users interested in seeing a smaller set of relevant differences should consider comparing against src/modules/standard/mod_include.c from the 1.3b3 release.  Non-indentation changes to mod_include between 1.2 and 1.3 were minimal.  [Dean Gaudet, Marc Slemko]

----------------------------
*) CONFIG: The LockFile directive can be used to place the serializing lockfile in any location.  It previously defaulted to /usr/tmp/htlock. [Somehow it took four of us: Randy Terbush, Jim Jagielski, Dean Gaudet, Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) Request processing now retains state of whether or not the request body has been read, so that internal redirects and subrequests will not try to read it twice (and block). [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Attempt to work around problems with third party libraries that do not handle high numbered descriptors (examples include bind, and solaris libc).  On all systems apache attempts to keep all permanent descriptors above 15 (called the low slack line).  Solaris users can also benefit from adding -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256 to EXTRA_CFLAGS which keeps all non-FILE * descriptors above 255.  On all systems this should make supporting large numbers of vhosts with many open log files more feasible.  If this causes trouble please report it, you can disable this workaround by adding -DNO_SLACK to EXTRA_CFLAGS. [Dean Gaudet] various PRs	
----------------------------
*) Related to the last entry, network sockets are now opened before log files are opened.  The only known case where this can cause problems is under Solaris with many virtualhosts and many Listen directives.  But using -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256 described above will work around this problem.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Update mod_rewrite from 3.0.5 to 3.0.6.  New ruleflag QSA=query_string_append.  Also fixed a nasty bug in per-dir context: when a URL http://... was used in conjunction with a special redirect flag, e.g. R=permanent, the permanent status was lost. [Ronald Tschalaer <Ronald.Tschalaer psi.ch>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

*) The OS/2 handling of process group was broken by a porting patch for MPE, so restored prior code for OS/2.  [Roy Fielding and Garey Smiley]	
----------------------------
*) If the lookup for a DirectoryIndex name with content negotiation has found matching variants, but none are acceptable, return the negotiation result if there are no more DirectoryIndex names to lookup. [Petr Lampa and Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) If a soft_timeout occurs after keepalive is set, then the main child loop would try to read another request even though the connection has been aborted.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Configure changes: Allow for whitespace at the start of a Module declaration. Also, be more understanding about the CC=/OPTIM= format in Configuration. Finally, fix compiler flags if using HP-UX's cc compiler. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Subrequests and internal redirects now inherit the_request from the original request-line. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Test for error conditions before creating output header fields, since we don't want the error message to include those fields.  Likewise, reset the content_language(s) and content_encoding of the response before generating or redirecting to an error message, since the new message will have its own Content-* definitions. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed a couple places where a check for the default Content-Type was not properly checking both the value configured by the DefaultType directive and the DEFAULT_TYPE symbol in httpd.h.  Changed the value of DEFAULT_TYPE to match the documented default (text/plain). [Dean Gaudet] PR#506	
----------------------------
*) Properly initialize the flock structures used by the mutex locking around accept() when USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is defined. [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) The method for determining PATH_INFO has been restored to the pre-1.2b (and NCSA httpd) definition wherein it was the extra path info beyond the CGI script filename.  The environment variable FILEPATH_INFO has been removed, and instead we supply the original REQUEST_URI to any script that wants to be Apache-specific and needs the real URI path. This solves a problem with existing scripts that use extra path info in the ScriptAlias directive to pass options to the CGI script. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) The _default_ change in 1.2b10 will change the behaviour on configs that use multiple Listen statements for listening on multiple ports. But that change is necessary to make _default_ consistent with other forms of <VirtualHost>.  It requires such configs to be modified to use <VirtualHost _default_:*>.  The documentation has been updated.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#530	
----------------------------
*) If an ErrorDocument CGI script is used to respond to an error generated by another CGI script which has already read the message body of the request, the server would block trying to read the message body again.  [Rob Hartill]

*) Fix problem with scripts not receiving a SIGPIPE when client drops the connection (e.g., when user presses Stop).  Apache will now stop trying to send a message body immediately after an error from write. [Roy Fielding and Nathan Kurz] PR#335	
----------------------------
*) Rearrange Configuration.tmpl so that mod_rewrite has higher priority than mod_alias, and mod_alias has higher priority than mod_proxy; rearranged other modules to enhance understanding of their purpose and relative order (and maybe even reduce some overhead). [Roy Fielding and Sameer Parekh]	
----------------------------
*) Allow suexec to access files relative to current directory but not above.  (Excluding leading / or any .. directory.)  [Ken Coar] PR#269, 319, 395	
----------------------------
*) Fix suexec segfault when group doesn't exist. [Gregory Neil Shapiro] PR#367, 368, 354, 453	
----------------------------
*) Fix the above fix: if suexec is enabled, avoid destroying r->url while obtaining the /~user and save the username in a separate data area so that it won't be overwritten by the call to getgrgid(), and fix some misuse of the pool string allocation functions.  Also fixes a general problem with parsing URL query info into args for CGI scripts. [Roy Fielding] PR#339, 367, 354, 453

*) If a soft timeout (or lingerout) occurs while trying to flush a buffer or write inside buff.c or fread'ing from a CGI's output, then the timeout would be ignored. [Roy Fielding] PR#373	
----------------------------
*) Fixed SIGSEGV problem when a DirectoryIndex file is also the source of an external redirection.  [Roy Fielding and Paul Sutton]	
----------------------------
*) Configure would create a broken Makefile if the configuration file contained a commented-out Rule.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Promote per_dir_config and subprocess_env from the subrequest to the main request in mod_negotiation.  In particular this fixes a bug where <Files> sections wouldn't properly apply to negotiated content. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Fix a potential deadlock in mod_cgi script_err handling. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Updated mod_rewrite to 3.0.4: Fixes HTTP redirects from within .htaccess files because the RewriteBase was not replaced correctly. Updated mod_rewrite to 3.0.5: Fixes problem with rewriting inside <Directory> sections missing a trailing /.  [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) Redirect did not preserve ?query_strings when present in the client's request.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Configure was finding non-modules on EXTRA_LIBS. [Frank Cringle] PR#380	
----------------------------
*) Add mod_example (illustration of API techniques).  [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) HARD_SERVER_LIMIT can be defined in the Configuration file now. [Dean Gaudet] Changes with Apache 1.2b8	
----------------------------
*) suexec.c doesn't close the log file, allowing CGIs to continue writing to it.  [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) The addition of <Location> and <File> directives made the sub_req_lookup_simple() function bogus, so we now handle the special cases directly.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Improved lingering_close by adding a special timeout, removing the spurious log messages, removing the nonblocking settings (they are not needed with the better timeout), and adding commentary about the NO_LINGCLOSE and USE_SO_LINGER issues.  NO_LINGCLOSE is now the default for SunOS4, UnixWare, NeXT, and IRIX.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the handling of module and script-added header fields. Improved the interface for sending header fields and reduced the duplication of code between sending okay responses and errors. We now always send both headers_out and err_headers_out, and ensure that the server-reserved fields are not being overridden, while not overriding those that are not reserved.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed the determination of whether or not we should make the connection persistent for all of the cases where some other part of the server has already indicated that we should not.  Also improved the ordering of the test so that chunked encoding will be set whenever it is desired instead of only when KeepAlive is enabled. Added persistent connection capability for most error responses (those that do not indicate a bad input stream) when accessed by an HTTP/1.1 client. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Added missing timeouts for sending header fields, error responses, and the last chunk of chunked encoding, each of which could have resulted in a process being stuck in write forever.  Using soft_timeout requires that the sender check for an aborted connection rather than continuing after an EINTR.  Timeouts that used to be initiated before send_http_header (and never killed) are now initiated only within or around the routines that actually do the sending, and not allowed to propagate above the caller.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) per_dir_defaults weren't set correctly until directory_walk for name-based vhosts.  This fixes an obscure bug with the wrong config info being used for vhosts that share the same ip as the server. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Generate makefile dependency for Configuration based on the actual name given when running the Configure process.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Try to continue gracefully by disabling the vhost if a DNS lookup fails while parsing the configuration file.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Reduced IdentityCheck timeout to 30 seconds, as per RFC 1413 minimum. [Ken Coar]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed problem with ErrorDocument not working for virtual hosts due to one of the performance changes in 1.2b7. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed user and server confusion over what should be a virtual host and what is the main server, resulting in access to something other than the name defined in the virtualhost directive (but with the same IP address) failing. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Updated mod_rewrite to version 3.0.2, which: fixes compile error on AIX; improves the redirection stuff to enable the users to generally redirect to http, https, gopher and ftp; added TIME variable for RewriteCond which expands to YYYYMMDDHHMMSS strings and added the special patterns >STRING, <STRING and =STRING to RewriteCond, which can be used in conjunction with %{TIME} or other variables to create time-dependent rewriting rules. [Ralf S. Engelschall]	
----------------------------
*) bpushfd() no longer notes cleanups for the file descriptors it is handed. Module authors may need to adjust their code for proper cleanup to take place (that is, call note_cleanups_for_fd()). This change fixes problems with file descriptors being erroneously closed when the proxy module was in use. [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Fix bug in suexec reintroduced by changes in 1.2b7 which allows initgroups() to hose the group information needed for later comparisons. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) Clear memory allocated for listeners. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) Improved handling of IP address as a virtualhost address and introduced ""_default_"" as a synonym for the default vhost config. [Dean Gaudet] PR #212 Changes with Apache 1.2b7"	
----------------------------
*) mod_negotiation fixes [Petr Lampa] PR#157, PR#158, PR#159 - replace protocol response numbers with symbols - save variant-list into main request notes - free allocated memory from subrequests - merge notes, headers_out and err_headers_out	
----------------------------
*) more proxy FTP bug fixes: - Changed send_dir() to remove user/passwd from displayed URL. - Changed login error messages to be more descriptive. - remove setting of SO_DEBUG socket option - Make ftp_getrc() more lenient about multiline responses, specifically, 230 responses which don't have continuation 230- on each line). These seem to be all NT FTP servers, and while perhaps questionable, they appear to be legal by RFC 959. - Add missing kill_timeout() after transfer to user completes. [Chuck Murcko]	
----------------------------
*) Reduced the default timeout from 1200 seconds to 300, and the one in the sample configfile from 400 to 300.  [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed problem with mod_cgi-generated internal redirects trying to read the request message-body twice. [Archie Cobbs and Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Reduced timeout on lingering close, removed possibility of a blocked read causing the child to hang, and stopped logging of errors if the socket is not connected (reset by client).  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Rearranged main child loop to remove duplication of code in select/accept and keep-alive requests, fixed several bugs regarding checking scoreboard_image for exit indication and failure to account for all success conditions and trap all error conditions, prevented multiple flushes before closing the socket; close the entire socket buffer instead of just one descriptor, prevent logging of EPROTO and ECONNABORTED on platforms where supported, and generally improved readability.  [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Several fixes for suexec wrapper. [Randy Terbush] - Make wrapper work for files on NFS filesystem. - Fix portability problem of MAXPATHLEN. - Fix array overrun problem in clean_env(). - Fix allocation of PATH environment variable	
----------------------------
*) Removed extraneous blank line is description of mod_status chars. [Kurt Kohler]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed core dump when DocumentRoot is a CGI. [Ben Laurie, reported by <geddis tesserae.com>]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed potential file descriptor leak in mod_asis; updated it and http_core to use pfopen/pfclose instead of fopen/fclose. [Randy Terbush and Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Return a 302 response code to the client when sending a redirect due to a missing trailing '/' on a directory instead of a 301; now it is cacheable. [Markus Gyger]	
----------------------------
*) Fix condition where, if a bad directive occurs in .htaccess, and sub_request() goes first to this directory, then log_reason() will SIGSEGV because it doesn't have initialized r->per_dir_config. [PR#162 from Petr Lampa, fix by Marc Slemko and Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Remove free() from clean_env() in suexec wrapper. This was nuking the clean environment on some systems.	
----------------------------
*) Improved buffered output to the client by delaying the flush decision until the BUFF code is actually about to read the next request. This fixes a problem introduced in 1.2b5 with clients that send an extra CRLF after a POST request. Also improved chunked output performance by combining writes using writev() and removing as many bflush() calls as possible.  NOTE: Platforms without writev() must add -DNO_WRITEV to the compiler CFLAGS, either in Configuration or Configure, unless we have already done so.  [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed http_protocol to correctly output all HTTP/1.1 headers, including for the special case of a 304 response.  [Paul Sutton]	
----------------------------
*) Change KeepAlive semantics (On|Off instead of a number), add MaxKeepAliveRequests directive. [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
*) Don't call can_exec() if suexec_enabled. Calling this requires scripts executed by the suexec wrapper to be world executable, which defeats one of the advantages of running the wrapper. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) mod_info assumed that the config files were relative to ServerRoot. [Ken the Rodent]	
----------------------------
*) CGI scripts called as an error document resulting from failed CGI execution would hang waiting for POST'ed data. [Rob Hartill]	
----------------------------
*) Several security enhancements to suexec wrapper. It is _highly_ recommended that previously installed versions of the wrapper be replaced with this version.  [Randy Terbush, Jason Dour] - ~user execution now properly restricted to ~user's home directory and below. - execution restricted to UID/GID > 100 - restrict passed environment to known variables - call setgid() before initgroups() (portability fix) - remove use of setenv() (portability fix)	
----------------------------
*) Fix incorrect comparison which could allow number of children = MaxClients + 1 if less than HARD_SERVER_LIMIT. Also fix potential problem if StartServers > HARD_SERVER_LIMIT. [Ed Korthof]	
----------------------------
*) Replace instances of inet_ntoa() with inet_addr() for ProxyBlock. It's more portable. [Martin Kraemer]	
----------------------------
*) Add ProxyBlock directive w/IP address caching. Add IP address caching to NoCache directive as well. ProxyBlock works with all handlers; NoCache now also works with FTP for anonymous logins. Still more code cleanup. [Chuck Murcko]	
----------------------------
*) suEXEC wrapper was freeing memory that had not been malloc'ed.	
----------------------------
*) Correctly allow access and auth directives in <Files> sections in server config files. [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
*) Fix bug with ServerPath that could cause certain files to be not found by the server. [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
*) Fix handling of ErrorDocument so that it doesn't remove a trailing double-quote from text and so that it properly checks for unsupported status codes using the new index_of_response interface. [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Multiple fixes to the lingering_close code in order to avoid being interrupted by a stray timeout, to avoid lingering on a connection that has already been aborted or never really existed, to ensure that we stop lingering as soon as any error condition is received, and to prevent being stuck indefinitely if the read blocks.  Also improves reporting of error conditions.  [Marc Slemko and Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed initialization of parameter structure for sigaction. [<mgyger itr.ch>, Adrian Filipi-Martin]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed bug in bcwrite regarding failure to account for partial writes. Avoided calling bflush() when the client is pipelining requests. Removed unnecessary flushes from http_protocol. [Dean Gaudet]	
----------------------------
"*) Added description of ""."" mode in server-status [Jim Jagielski] Changes with Apache 1.2b4"	
----------------------------
*) Fix possible race condition in accept_mutex_init() that could leave a small security hole open allowing files to be overwritten in cases where the server UID has write permissions. [Marc Slemko]	
----------------------------
*) Fix awk compatibilty problem in Configure. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Fix portablity problem in util_script where ARG_MAX may not be defined for some systems.	
----------------------------
*) OS/2 changes to support an MMAP style scoreboard file and UNIX style magic #! token for better script portability. [Garey Smiley]	
----------------------------
*) Fix bug in suexec wrapper introduced in b3 that would cause failed execution for ~userdir CGI. [Jason Dour]	
----------------------------
*) Fix initgroups() business in suexec wrapper. [Jason Dour]	
----------------------------
*) Fix month off by one in suexec wrapper logging. Changes with Apache 1.2b3:	
----------------------------
*) Add changes to improve the error message given for invalid ServerName parameters. [Dirk vanGulik]	
----------------------------
*) Remove requirement for ResourceConfig/AccessConfig if not using the three config file layout. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) Changes to suexec wrapper to fix the following problems: 1.  symlinked homedirs will kill ~userdirs. 2.  initgroups() on Linux 2.0.x clobbers gr->grid. 3.  CGI command lines paramters problems 4.  pw-pwdir for ""docroot check"" still the httpd user's pw record. [Randy Terbush, Jason Dour]"	
----------------------------
*) Change create_argv() to accept variable arguments. This fixes a problem where arguments were not getting passed to the CGI via argv[] when the suexec wrapper was active. [Randy Terbush, Jake Buchholz]	
----------------------------
*) Collapse multiple slashes in path URLs to properly apply handlers defined by <Location>. [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
*) Define a sane set of DEFAULT_USER and DEFAULT_GROUP values for AIX.	
----------------------------
*) Reset timeout while reading via get_client_block() in mod_cgi.c Fixes problem with timed out transfers of large files. [Rasmus Lerdorf]	
----------------------------
*) Add the ability to pass different Makefile.tmpl files to Configure using the -make flag. [Rob Hartill]	
----------------------------
*) Fix coredump triggered when sending a SIGHUP to the server caused by an assertion failure, in turn caused by an uninitialised field in a listen_rec. [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Defined rlim_t and WANTHSREGEX=yes and fixed waitpid() substitute for NeXT. [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) Removed recent modification to promote the status code on internal redirects, since the correct fix was to change the default log format in mod_log_config so that it outputs the original status. [Rob Hartill] Changes with Apache 1.2b2:	
----------------------------
*) Update set_signals() to use sigaction() for setting handlers. This appears to fix a re-entrant problem in the seg_fault() bus_error() handlers. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) proxy_http.c bugfixes:  [Chuck Murcko] 1) fixes possible NULL pointer reference w/NoCache 2) fixes NoCache behavior when using ProxyRemote (ProxyRemote host would cache nothing if it was in the local domain, and the local domain was in the NoCache list) 3) Adds Host: header when not available 4) Some code cleanup and clarification	
----------------------------
*) mod_include.c bugfixes: 1) Fixed an ommission that caused include variables to not be parsed in config errmsg directives [Howard Fear] 2) Remove HAVE_POSIX_REGEX cruft [Alexei Kosut] 3) Patch to fix compiler warnings [<perrot lal.in2p3.fr>] 4) Allow backslash-escaping to all quoted text [Ben Yoshino <ben wiliki.eng.hawaii.edu>] 5) Pass variable to command line if not set in XSSI's env [Howard Fear]	
----------------------------
*) Closed file-globbing hole in test-cgi script. [Brian Behlendorf]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed problem in set_[user|group] that prevented CGI execution for non-virtualhosts when suEXEC was enabled. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) Changed default group to ""nogroup"" instead of ""nobody"" [Randy Terbush]"	
----------------------------
*) Added comment to explain (r->chunked = 1) side-effect in http_protocol.c [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Updated Configure for ... OS/2          (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes, other code changes) *-dg-dgux*    (bad pattern match) QNX           (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes) *-sunos4*     (DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes, -DUSEBCOPY) *-ultrix      (new) *-unixware211 (new) and added some user diagnostic info.  [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed bug where Redirect in .htaccess files would cause memory leak. [Nathan Neulinger]	
----------------------------
*) MultiViews now works correctly with AddHandler [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
"*) Fix misspelling of ""Anonymous_Authorative"" directive in mod_auth_anon. Changes with Apache 1.1.0"	
----------------------------
*) Make virtual hosts default to main server keepalive parameters. [Alexei Kosut, Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) mod_env now turned on by default in Configuration.tmpl.	
----------------------------
*) Previously broken multi-method <Limit> parsing fixed. [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) VirtualHosts based on Host: headers no longer conflict with the Listen directive.	
----------------------------
*) POST now allowed to directory index CGI scripts.	
----------------------------
*) Actions now work with files of the default type.	
----------------------------
*) Bugs which were fixed: a) more mod_proxy bugs b) early termination of inetd requests c) compile warnings on several systems d) problems when scripts stop reading output early Changes with Apache 1.1b3	
----------------------------
*) CONNECT method for proxy module, which means tunneling SSL should work. (No crypto needed)  Also a NoCache config directive.	
----------------------------
"*) ""ServerPath"" directive added - allows for graceful transition for Host:-header-based virtual hosts."	
----------------------------
*) Anonymous authentication module improvements.	
----------------------------
*) Bugs which were fixed: a) numerous mod_proxy bugs b) CGI early-termination bug [Ben Laurie] c) Keepalives not working with virtual hosts d) RefererIgnore problems e) closing fd's twice in mod_include (causing core dumps on Linux and elsewhere). Changes with Apache 1.1b2	
----------------------------
*) Internal redirects which occur in mod_dir.c now preserve the query portion of a request (the bit after the question mark). [Adam Sussman]	
----------------------------
*) Escape active characters '<', '>' and '&' in html output in directory listings, error messages and redirection links. [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Reset timeout timer after each successful fwrite() to the network. This patch adds a reset_timeout() procedure that is called by send_fd() to reset the timeout ever time data is written to the net. [Nathan Schrenk]	
----------------------------
*) timeout() signal handler now checks for SIGPIPE and reports lost connections in a more user friendly way. [Rob Hartill]	
----------------------------
"*) Location of the ""scoreboard"" file which used to live in /tmp is now configurable (for OSes that can't use mmap) via ScoreBoardFile which works similar to PidFile (in httpd.conf) [Rob Hartill]"	
----------------------------
*) Output warning when MinSpareServers is set to <= 0 and change it to 1 [Rob Hartill]	
----------------------------
*) past changes to http_config.c to only use the setrlimit function on systems defining RLIMIT_NOFILE broke the feature on SUNOS4. Now defines HAVE_RESOURCE for SUNOS and prototypes the needed functions.	
----------------------------
*) Merge multiple headers from CGI scripts instead of taking last one. [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Silence mod_log_referer and mod_log_agent if not configured [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) The replacement for initgroups() did not call {set,end}grent(). This had two implications: if anything else used getgrent(), then initgroups() would fail, and it was consuming a file descriptor. [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) .htgroup files can have more than one line giving members for a given group (each must have the group name in front), for NCSA back-compatibility [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) AddType, AddEncoding, and AddLanguage directives take multiple extensions on a single command line [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
"*) UserDir can be disabled for a given virtual host by saying ""UserDir disabled"" in the <VirtualHost> section --- it was a bug that this didn't work.  [David Robinson]"	
----------------------------
*) httpd does a perror() before exiting if it can't log its pid to the PidFile, to make diagnosing the error a bit easier. [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed bug involving handling URIs with escaped %-characters in redirects [David Robinson] Changes with Apache 0.8.15                                       14 Oct 1995	
----------------------------
*) Eliminated core dumps with improperly formatted DBM group files [Mark Cox]	
----------------------------
*) Correctly handles internal redirects to files with names containing '%' [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
"*) Somewhat better fix for the old ""Alias /foo/ /bar/"" business [David Robinson]"	
----------------------------
*) Don't repeatedly open the ErrorLog if a bunch of <VirtualHost> entries all name the same one. [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Sample Config files have extra note for SCO users [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Configuration has note for HP-UX users [Rob Hartill]	
----------------------------
*) AddDescription works (better) [Ben Laurie]	
----------------------------
*) Leaves an intelligible error diagnostic when it can't set group privileges on standalone startup [Andrew Wilson]	
----------------------------
*) Make IndexIgnore *work* (ooops) [Jarkko Torppa]	
----------------------------
*) Properly default ServerName for virtual servers [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) On self-identified BSD systems (we don't try to guess any more), allocate a few extra file descriptors per virtual host with setrlimit, if we can, to avoid running out. [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) Doesn't pause three seconds after including a CGI script which is too slow to die off (this is done by not even trying to kill off subprocesses, including the SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL routine, until after the entire document has been processed).  [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) Doesn't do SSI if Options Includes is off.  (Ooops).  [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Options IncludesNoExec allows inclusion of at least text/* [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Allows .htaccess files to override <Directory> sections naming the same directory [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Removed an efficiency hack in sub_req_lookup_uri which was causing certain extremely marginal cases (e.g., ScriptAlias of a *particular* index.html file) to fail.  [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
"*) Configuration script accepts ""Module"" lines with trailing whitespace. [Robert Thau]"	
----------------------------
*) Wildcard <Directory> specifications work.  [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) Doesn't reset DirectoryIndex to 'index.html' when other directory options are set in a .htaccess file.  [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) Corrected several directives in sample srm.conf --- includes corrections to directory indexing icon-related directives (using unknown.gif rather than unknown.xbm as the DefaultIcon, doing icons for encodings right, and turning on AddEncoding by default). [Roy Fielding]	
----------------------------
*) Corrected descriptions of args to AddIcon and AddAlt in command table [James Cloos]	
----------------------------
*) Fixed ScriptAlias/Alias interaction by moving ScriptAlias handling to mod_alias.c, merging it almost completely with handling of Alias, and adding a 'notes' field to the request_rec which allows the CGI module to discover whether the Alias module has put this request through ScriptAlias (which it needs to know for back-compatibility, as the old NCSA code did not check Options ExecCGI in ScriptAlias directories). [Robert Thau] Changes with Apache 0.8.10                                       18 Aug 1995	
----------------------------
*) AllowOverride applies to the named directory, and not just subdirectories.  [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
"*) <!--exec cgi=""/some/uri/here""--> always treats the item named by the URI as a CGI script, even if it would have been treated as something else if requested directly, for NCSA back-compatibility.  (Note that this means that people who know the name of the script can see the code just by asking for it).  [Robert Thau]"	
----------------------------
*) New version of dbmmanage script included in support directory as dbmmanage.new.	
----------------------------
*) AddIcon and AddAlt commands work properly [Rob Hartill]	
----------------------------
*) Really honor CacheNegotiatedDocs [Florent Guillaume]	
----------------------------
*) Give Redirect priority over Alias, for NCSA bug compatibility [David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) If DBM auth is improperly configured, report a server error and don't dump core.	
----------------------------
*) More improvements to default Configuration for A/UX [Jim Jagielski]	
----------------------------
*) SunOS library prototypes now never included unless explicitly requested in the configuration (via -DSUNOS_LIB_PROTOTYPES); people using GNU libc on SunOS are screwed by prototypes for the standard library. (Those who wish to compile clean with gcc -Wall on a standard SunOS setup need the prototypes, and may obtain them using -DSUNOS_LIB_PROTOTYPES.  Those wishing to use -Wall on a system with nonstandard libraries are presumably competent to make their own arrangements).	
----------------------------
*) Strips trailing '/' characters off both args to the Alias command, to make 'Alias /foo/ /bar/' work. Changes with Apache 0.8.7                                        03 Aug 1995	
----------------------------
"*) Don't hang when restarting with a child from 'TransferLog ""|...""' running [reported by David Robinson]"	
----------------------------
*) Added some of the more recent significant changes (AddLanguage stuff, experimental LogFormat support) to CHANGES file in distribution root directory Changes with Apache 0.8.6                                        02 Aug 1995	
----------------------------
*) Added last-minute configurable log experiment, as optional module	
----------------------------
*) Correctly set r->bytes_sent for HTTP/0.9 requests, so they get logged properly.  (One-line fix to http_protocol.c).	
----------------------------
*) IdentityCheck bugfix [Chuck Murcko].	
----------------------------
*) Corrected cgi-src/Makefile entry for new imagemap script.  [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
*) More sample config file corrections; add extension to AddType for *.asis, move AddType generic description to its proper place, and fix miscellaneous typos. [ Alexei Kosut ]	
----------------------------
"*) Changes to server-pool management parms --- renamed current StartServers to MinSpareServers, created separate StartServers parameter which means what it says, and renamed MaxServers to MaxSpareServers (though the old name still works, for NCSA 1.4 back-compatibility).  The old names were generally regarded as too confusing.  Also altered ""docs"" in sample config files."	
----------------------------
*) More improvements to default config files --- sample directives (commented out) for XBitHack, BindAddress, CacheNegotiatedDocs, VirtualHost; decent set of AddLanguage defaults, AddTypes for send-as-is and imagemap magic types, and improvements to samples for DirectoryIndex [Alexei Kosut]	
----------------------------
*) Yet more improvements to default config files --- changes to Alexei's sample AddLanguage directives, and sample LanguagePriority [ Florent Guillaume ]	
----------------------------
*) Set config file locations properly if not set in httpd.conf [ David Robinson ]	
----------------------------
*) Don't escape URIs in internal redirects multiple times; don't do that when translating PATH_INFO to PATH_TRANSLATED either. [ David Robinson ]	
----------------------------
*) Upgraded imagemap script in cgi-bin to 1.8 version from more recent NCSA distributions.	
----------------------------
*) Bug fix to previous bug fix --- if .htaccess file and <Directory> exist for the same directory, use both and don't segfault.  [Reported by David Robinson]	
----------------------------
*) Lightly edited sample config files to refer people to our documentation instead of NCSA's, and to list Rob McCool as *original* author (also deleted his old, and no doubt non-functional email address).  Would be nice to have examples of new features... Changes with Apache 0.8.2                                        19 Jul 1995	
----------------------------
"*) Don't say ""access forbidden"" when a CGI script is not found.  [Mark Cox]"	
----------------------------
*) Imagemap module is enabled in default Configuration	
----------------------------
*) RefererLog and UserAgentLog modules properly default the logfile [Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
*) Mark Cox's mod_cookies added to the distribution as an optional module (commented out in the default Configuration, and noted as an experiment, along with mod_dld). [Mark Cox]	
----------------------------
*) New config script.  See INSTALL for info.  [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
"*) Scoreboard mechanism for regulating the number of extant server processes.  MaxServers and StartServers defaults are the same as for NCSA, but the meanings are slightly different.  (Actually, I should probably lower the MaxServers default to 10). Before asking for a new connection, each server process checks the number of other servers which are also waiting for a connection.  If there are more than MaxServers, it quietly dies off.  Conversely, every second, the root, or caretaker, process looks to see how many servers are waiting for a new connection; if there are fewer than StartServers, it starts a new one.  This does not depend on the number of server processes already extant. The accounting is arranged through a ""scoreboard"" file, named /tmp/htstatus.*, on which each process has an independent file descriptor (they need to seek without interference). The end effect is that MaxServers is the maximum number of servers on an *inactive* server machine, but more will be forked off to handle unusually heavy loads (or unusually slow clients); these will die off when they are no longer needed --- without reverting to the overhead of full forking operation.  There is a hard maximum of 150 server processes compiled in, largely to avoid forking out of control and dragging the machine down. (This is arguably too high). In my server endurance tests, this mechanism did not appear to impose any significant overhead, even after I forced it to put the scoreboard file on a normal filesystem (which might have more overhead than tmpfs).  [Robert Thau]"	
----------------------------
*) Set HTTP_FOO variables for SSI <!--#exec cmd-->s, not just CGI scripts. [Cliff Skolnick]	
----------------------------
*) Read .htaccess files even in directory with <Directory> section. (Former incompatibility noted on mailing list, now fixed). [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
"*) Don't produce double error reports for some very obscure cases mainly involving auth configuration (the ""all modules decline to handle"" case which is a sure sign of a server bug in most cases, but also happens when authentication is badly misconfigured). [Robert Thau]"	
----------------------------
*) Fixed auth_name-related typos in http_core.c [Brian Behlendorf] Also, fixed auth typo in http_protocol.c unmasked by this fix.	
----------------------------
*) Reordered modules in modules.c so that Redirect takes priority over ScriptAlias, for NCSA bug-compatibility [Rob Hartill] --- believe it or not, he has an actual site with a ScriptAlias and a Redirect declared for the *exact same directory*.  Even *my* compatibility fetish wouldn't motivate me to fix this if the fix required any effort, but it doesn't, so what the hey.	
----------------------------
"*) Two styles of timeout --- hard and soft.  soft_timeout()s just put the connection to the client in an ""aborted"" state, but otherwise allow whatever handlers are running to clean up.  hard_timeout()s abort the request in progress completely; anything not tied to some resource pool cleanup will leak.  They're still around because I haven't yet come up with a more elegant way of handling timeouts when talking to something that isn't the client.  The default_handler and the dir_handler now use soft timeouts, largely so I can test the feature.  [Robert Thau]"	
----------------------------
"*) TransferLog ""| my_postprocessor ..."" seems to be there.  Note that the case of log handlers dying prematurely is probably handled VERY gracelessly at this point, and if the logger stops reading input, the server will hang.  (It is known to correctly restart the logging process on server restart; this is (should be!) going through the same SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL routine used to ding an errant CGI script).  [Robert Thau]"	
----------------------------
*) IdentityCheck code is compiled in, but has not been tested.  (I don't know anyone who runs identd). [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) Deleted the block_alarms() stuff from dbm_auth; no longer necessary, as timeouts are not in scope. [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) quoted-string args in config files now handled correctly (doesn't drop the last character). [Robert Thau; reported by Randy Terbush]	
----------------------------
"*) Another Cliff bug --- ""GET /~user"" now properly redirects (the userdir code no longer sets up bogus PATH_INFO which fakes out the directory handler). [Cliff Skolnick] Changes with Shambhala 0.5.2                                     06 Jul 1995"	
----------------------------
*) Changes to http_main.c --- root server no longer plays silly games with SIGCHLD, and so now detects and replaces dying children.  Child processes just die on SIGTERM, without taking the whole process group with them.  Potential problem --- if any child process refuses to die, we hang in restart. MaxRequestsPerChild may still not work, but it certainly works better than it did before this!  [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) mod_dir.c bug fixes: ReadmeName and HeaderName work (or work better, at least); over-long description lines properly terminated. [Mark Cox]	
----------------------------
*) Generalized cleanup interface in alloc.c --- any function can be registered with alloc.c as a cleanup for a resource pool; tracking of files and file descriptors has been reimplemented in terms of this interface, so I can give it some sort of a test. [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) More changes in alloc.c --- new cleanup_for_exec() function, which tracks down and closes all file descriptors which have been registered with the alloc.c machinery before the server exec()s a child process for CGI or <!--#exec-->.  CGI children now get started with exactly three file descriptors open.  Hopefully, this cures the problem Rob H. was having with overly persistent CGI connections. [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) Mutual exclusion around the accept() in child_main() --- this is required on at least SGI, Solaris and Linux, and is #ifdef'ed in by default on those systems only (-DFCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT). This uses fcntl(F_SETLK,...) on the error log descriptor because flock() on that descriptor won't work on systems which have BSD flock() semantics, including (I think) Linux 1.3 and Solaris. This does work on SunOS (when the server is idle, only one process in the pool is waiting on accept()); it *ought* to work on the other systems. [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) block_alarms() to avoid leaking the DBM* in dbm auth (this should be unnecessary if I go to the revised timeout-handling scheme). [Robert Thau]	
----------------------------
*) Add wildcard content handlers for XBITHACK; default_hander now invoked with that mechanism (as a handler hanging off mod_core) [rst]	
----------------------------
"*) XBITHACK supported as a wildcard content-handler, and configurable at run-time (not just at compile time, as in the ""patchy server"" releases) [rst] Changes with Shambhala 0.4.4                                     30 Jun 1995"	
----------------------------
*) Handle Addtype x/y .z [rst, reported by Cox] Changes with Shambhala 0.4.3	
----------------------------
"*) Fixed very dumb bug in mod_alias; ""Alias"" and ""Redirect"" are not synonymous [rst, terbush] Changes with Shambhala 0.4.1                                     28 Jun 1995"	
----------------------------
*) First-cut virtual host implementation; some refit in the config reading code, and log management, was necessary to support this [rst]	
----------------------------
*) Significant code reorg within the server core to group related functions together [rst]	
----------------------------
"*) Replace dying child processes. [rst] Changes with Shambhala 0.1                                       12 Jun 1995 Major rewrite of the pre-existing ""patchy server"" codebase, by Robert Thau (rst).  Significant portions of the server code, such as configuration-file handling and HTTP authentication support, were ripped out and rewritten from scratch.  Code that was not completely rewritten was significantly altered. Major changes with this release include:"	
----------------------------
*) Introduction of the module API; in request handling, the central machinery just dispatches to various modules, which actually do most of the work.  Configuration handling is similar --- modules declare their own commands, and the central machinery just dispatches to them. API features from shambhala/0.1 were substantially unchanged in Apache 1.0 and 1.1.  (1.0 API features not yet present in this release, such as wildcard handlers and subpools, were added in subsequent Shambhala releases, and were also generally rst's work).	
----------------------------
*) This release included the following modules: mod_access      (access control --- allow and deny directives), mod_alias       (Alias and Redirect commands), mod_auth        (straight HTTP authentication, based on flat-files) mod_auth_dbm    (same, with dbm files) mod_cgi         (CGI scripts and, in this release, ScriptAlias) mod_common_log  (CLF access logs; later renamed mod_log_common) mod_dir         (directory indexing) mod_include     (server-side includes) mod_mime        (AddType directives) mod_negotiation (content negotiation) mod_userdir     (support for users' public_html directories) It also included a mod_ai_backcompat, which was a private hack for back-compatibility with rst's own AI-lab servers. All of these modules were substantially complete, and functional or nearly so (a few, which implemented features not in use at Thau's site, required patches of a few lines).
