    Introduce a meaningful .toString() for JimFS's Configuration class. Standard configurations have short, meaningful names (e.g. "Configuration{Unix}") while custom instances include the relevant details of the configuration.

    Fix comparison in JimfsPath that will always return false (as ArrayDeque is not
    a List) to simply compare the collections' elements.
    
    Eclipse caught this issue, warning "Unlikely argument type for equals():
    ImmutableList<Name> seems to be unrelated to Deque<Name>".
    
    Also applied two ErrorProne fixes to "Use grouping parenthesis to make the operator precedence explicit".

    Ignore errors that prevent Jimfs.newFileSystem from working in an environment where ServiceLoader doesn't work correctly to load the SystemJimfsFileSystemProvider.
    
    This is in relation to https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/31... I don't entirely understand what's going on there, but it does seem like an exception being thrown from FileSystems.newFileSystem should not prevent the user from getting the FileSystem that's already been created just because it can't be cached.

    A couple attribute-related changes:
    
    - Throw UOE instead of IAE when attempting to set an attribute that can't be set at all during file creation. This matches the behavior of the real file system implementations.
    - Make the owner:owner attribute not settable during file creation, which also matches the actual behavior.

    Throw UOE when setting unsupported attributes

commit e2ee28348ac179972ae24d0338fd32ac41915821
Author: Jason Tedor <jason@elastic.co>

    Throw UOE when setting unsupported attributes
    
    This commit modifies the behavior when setting unsupported attributes to
    throw an UnsupportedOperationException instead of an
    IllegalArgumentException. This is to make
    JimfsFileSystemProvider#createDirectory and
    JimfsFileSystemProvider#newByteChannel behave consistently with the
    Javadocs for FileSystemProvider#createDirectory and
    FileSystemProvider#newByteChannel which require an
    UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown when the array of attributes
    contains attributes which can not be set. In particular, these methods
    are invoked via Files#createTempDirectory and Files#createFile which
    have the same requirement regarding throwing an
    UnsupportedOperationException when the array of attributes contains
    attributes which can not be set. Most notably, this causes a discrepancy
    between the handling of Jimfs when configured to act like a Windows
    filesystem versus the behavior of sun.nio.fs.WindowsFileSystem where the
    former will throw an IllegalArgumentException if an attempt is made to
    set a POSIX attribute but the latter will throw an
    UnsupportedOperationException (consistent with the Javadocs).

    - Make SystemJimfsFileSystemProvider final.
    - Random whitespace fix.

    Fix flakiness in JimfsAsynchronousFileChannelTest.
    
    The tests are racy, and I don't have a good way to fix that. This change just makes the (much) rarer case where the race ends with the channel being closed before the read/write operations get to the point where they check that the channel is open also pass the test. Unfortunately it doesn't differentiate between that case happening once in a thousand times and happening every time (which would be a problem).
    
    Also simplify a bunch of stuff using SettableFuture.

    Add a method for getting the Configuration that the Jimfs.newFileSystem() overloads that don't take a Configuration use.
    
    This is primarily for allowing the user to create a modified version of that default configuration, which currently isn't possible without duplicating the logic to get the configuration.
    
    Also remove an unused constant. It's public, but it seems unlikely anyone's using it.

    Partially rollback previous change adding Turkish path normalization.
    
    We've determined that NTFS does not do locale-dependent case mapping (and neither do any other file systems we know of), so providing this option is unnecessary and misleading.
    
    I'm leaving the removal of a TODO I had to consider allowing Turkish-correct case folding and also adding in some notes about the whole situation for posterity.

Author: cgdecker <cgdecker@google.com>

    Several changes to JimfsFileChannel.
    
    - Update it to handle thread interruption for all methods that handle interruption in the default FileChannel implementation (with the exception of map(), for which we always throw UOE). For most methods that weren't already handling interruption, this mostly just means that if they're called on a thread that's already interrupted they'll throw ClosedByInterruptException and close the channel. Requested in GitHub issue #21. Also add tests for this.
    - Make it possible for FileChannel methods that don't use the channel's position (they have a parameter for a specific file position) to proceed concurrently with other FileChannel methods, which is specified as legal in the FileChannel docs: "Other operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may proceed concurrently".

    Change URIs for Unix- and Windows-like paths to end with a / if the file is a directory.
    
    See this issue: https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/16
    
    I was initially reluctant to do this because it seems strange to actually access the file system to convert a path to a URI, but this does in fact seem to be the behavior for actual Unix paths. Additionally, when looking into creating a ClassLoader that takes Path objects for the classpath, I noticed that URLClassLoader treats URLs that end with / differently (as directories) from those that don't, which indicates that there are real consequences for not doing this. Note: URLClassLoader is tied to the default file system via File/JarFile by default, so it's not like this change actually enables it to just work with Jimfs files (nor do I have any real reason to think you'd even want to do that, I was just curious).
    
    This involves changing the PathType API to take a boolean parameter indicating whether or not the file is a directory in its method for getting a URI path, which makes this an incompatible change that would probably require a 2.0 release (not that I expect anyone's actually implementing their own PathType).

    Split JimfsFileSystemProvider up to work around classloader issues.
    
    See https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/18 for more information.
    
    - SystemJimfsFileSystemProvider (which is loaded as a service by the system classloader) only serves as a cache of FileSystem instances as needed to make Paths.get(URI) work.
    - JimfsFileSystemProvider is the actual provider that is returned by JimfsFileSystem.provider(). It is a singleton and provides the real implementation of most of the FileSystemProvider methods, but does not cache FileSystem instances.
    
    We now create the FileSystem instances directly when the user calls Jimfs.newFileSystem rather than passing the Configuration off to FileSystems.newFileSystem. This should ensure no classloader issues when creating the FileSystem. Once created, the FileSystem itself is passed to FileSystems.newFileSystem. There should be no classloader issues here either, since the new SystemJimfsFileSystemProvider implementation does not deal with any other Jimfs-specific classes.
    
    Also add a test that fails without this change.

    Add support for "jimfs:" protocol URLs.
    
    For URLs to work, Java has to be able to find a URLStreamHandler implementation for the URL protocol/scheme. There isn't any really ideal way to do this programatically, but what this CL does is add "com.google.common" to the "java.protocol.handler.pkgs" system property when JimfsFileSystemProvider is initialized. This means that when Java tries to create a URL with the "jimfs" protocol, it'll look for "jimfs.Handler" under "com.google.common", find it and use it. (Documentation of that behavior found here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#URL-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-int-java.lang.String-)
    
    Fixes Github issue #13.

Author: cgdecker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 21 08:55:41 2015 -0800

    Change JimfsOutputStream.flush() to do nothing rather than throw an exception when the stream is already already closed.
    
    This matches the behavior of other core OutputStream implementations such as that returned by Files.newOutputStream(Path) for the default FileSystem and prevents an exception when nesting an OutputStream inside a BufferedOutputStream inside an OutputStreamWriter using try-with-resources under JDK8 (among any number of other situations that could cause the same problem).
    
    (Details: try-with-resources closes each declared resource in reverse order. Closing the OutputStreamWriter causes the BufferedOutputStream to be closed which causes the unbuffered OutputStream to be flushed and then closed. Closing the BufferedOutputStream then tries to flush the unbuffered OutputStream again. Prior to JDK8, any exception thrown by this flush() was swallowed and completely ignored; in JDK8, the behavior changed to (correctly) throw that exception.)

    Attempt to fix up some test flakiness.
    
    - Greatly increase timeout on PollingWatchService tests. The timeout shouldn't matter unless something's terribly wrong, so it should be ok to make it long.
    - Try to ensure that asynchronous close tests for JimfsFileChannel are working as expected by being more careful in ensuring that all threads start blocking properly. Also switch to using Truth instead of assertTrue so that we'll get error messages that are actually helpful if the tests still fail.

    Fix java 8 compilation failure.
    
    Type inference changes prevent this code from compiling in java 8. In general,
    methods that declare type parameters without using them in any formal parameter
    declarations should be avoided.

    Minor change to README to remove closing the FileSystem from the example.
    
    Since closing the FileSystem is not so important now that it can be GCed regardless.
    Also adds a small reference to Windows-style file systems and a disclaimer about the
    behavior's ability to exactly match that of any specific file system.

    Make closing a FileSystem also close all associated resources (streams, channels, watch services, etc.) and cause almost all other methods to throw ClosedFileSystemException, as per the spec of FileSystem.close(). Does not make Path methods that do not involve the file system itself throw, even if that would technically be the correct thing to do... just doesn't seem worth it to me.
    
    Fixes Github issues #3 and #4.

commit b6c9cdd4566de281061da48b19f1b6ef66f08b0f
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Tue May 13 18:49:44 2014 -0400

    Change JimfsFileSystemProvider to cache URI -> FileSystem mappings in a static map with weak values. To paraphrase the updated Javadoc:
    
    The cache is static to ensure that even when the provider isn't loaded by the system class loader, meaning that a new instance of it must be created each time one of the methods on FileSystems or Paths#get(URI) is called, cached file system instances are still available.
    
    The cache uses weak values so that it doesn't prevent file systems that are created but not closed from being garbage collected if no references to them are held elsewhere. This is a compromise between ensuring that any file URI continues to work as long as the file system hasn't been closed (which is technically the correct thing to do but unlikely to be something that most users care about) and ensuring that users don't get unexpected leaks of large amounts of memory because they're creating many file systems in tests but forgetting to close them (which seems likely to happen sometimes). Users that want to ensure that a file system won't be garbage collected just need to ensure they hold a reference to it somewhere for as long as they need it to stick around.

commit 93fc676aa649e52dc6e7d30e4462ce3abda9d1d1
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 28 18:45:55 2014 -0400

    Clean up misuses of Truth where proposition values are passed into ASSERT.that() instead of the object under test.  This leads to patterns like:
    
    ASSERT.that(myMap.values().isEmpty());
    
    The above will do exactly nothing, because Truth is a fluent API and expects a value and returns an object with custom proposition methods on it, i.e.
    
    ASSERT.that(myMap.values()).isEmpty(); is the appropriate fix.
    
    This is in preparation for an upgrade to Truth which includes @CheckReturnValue on methods like .that() in order to let error-prone flag these as a compile-error.

    Fix JimfsFileStore.getUsableSpace() to return unallocated space, not total. It's not clear from the Javadoc what exactly it should return, but checking the behavior of the real file system it does appear that usable space should be at most the unallocated space in the store.

    Add tests for moving and copying files from one JimfsFileSystem to another (moves/copies to FileSystems with different FileSystemProviders are handled by the Files class itself). Also fix an issue where attributes other than basic attributes were being copied from one file to a file on a different file system when COPY_ATTRIBUTES was specified--there's no guarantee that the other file system will support all the file attribute views the source file system does.

    When copying a file, move copying of regular file content outside the file system lock. Otherwise, concurrent copying of files is bottlenecked on the single lock and it's actually faster to copy using streams.

    This means that HeapDisk now uses a RegularFile for its block cache (only using the methods that were on BlockList), but it also saves an additional object per regular file.

    Get rid of public UserPrincipals class, moving its contents to package-private UserLookupService.
    
    Users can now only specify default user/group for a file system (in Configuration.Builder) using strings, which seems fine.

    Change directories to *not* unset their link to the parent directory when they are unlinked.
    
    Instead, when the directory is then linked in a new directory (as in a move), the parent link is overwritten with a new entry. When the directory is deleted, the parent link remains as long as the file object hangs around (as long as a SecureDirectoryStream is open to it, or for the lifetime of the FileSystem if the working directory was deleted.).
    
    This matches the behavior observed running in Linux, the only environment I've tried that supports SecureDirectoryStream.

commit 798390a83adcdf1cf2182b7891cd96ea6f7be3b6
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>

    Get rid of FileContent interface, changing all implementations to subclasses of File.
    
    While logically it seemed to make sense for the content of each file to be a separate object, it led to awkward code particularly when dealing with directories (since the content needed a reference to the File that contained it) and regular file streams/channels, which needed both a reference to the File and the content anyway.
    
    - ByteStore renamed to RegularFile.
    - DirectoryTable renamed to Directory.
    - DirectoryEntryMap inlined in to Directory.
    - SymbolicLink class added, which just contains a JimfsPath target.
    - Various code simplified to accept or return specific File subclasses.
    - Also re-add a package-info.java file, mostly just for @ParametersAreNonNullByDefault (for whatever good that does).
    
    This also has the effect of further reducing the number of objects per file in the file system. For example, where a directory was previously a File, DirectoryTable and DirectoryEntryMap, it's now just a Directory.

Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 5 17:03:29 2013 -0500

    Add the ability to limit disk size and to limit the maximum amount of unused space to keep cached.
    
    Also, since I feel pretty confident that using direct ByteBuffers for storage is no better than
    using heap arrays for most situations and that a disk-based approach (even with no actual caching)
    makes the most sense, consolidate down to only one file content implementation for the file system:
    
    - Delete DirectMemoryDisk
    - Roll HeapMemoryDisk implementation up in to MemoryDisk and make it final rather than abstract
    - Rename MemoryDisk to HeapDisk
    - Roll MemoryDiskByteStore up in to ByteStore and make ByteStore final rather than abstract

    Avoid allocation of attributes map in Inode unless it's needed.

    Synchronize access to attributes in Inode rather than using Atomic/Concurrent classes.

commit ef63fd55390d8ad83c8ed175e5f4ed70d9382cda
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 14 17:15:22 2013 -0400

    Greatly simplify attribute handling.
    
    The change gets rid of the Attribute class and the associated AbstractAttributeProvider,
    instead leaving each AttributeProvider to handle some of the type and settability checking
    that was handled by AttributeService before. This turns out to be easy to do in each
    AttributeProvider implementation and cuts down on a lot of complication.
    
    This also gets rid of the AttributeViews configuration class in favor of an
    AttributeConfiguration class. Attribute views are now configured by simply giving a
    list of String view identifiers for the views you want the file system to support.
    Custom providers can be added separately. Finally, overriding the default values for
    attributes is now handled by simply mapping the String attribute identifier
    (e.g "posix:group") to a default value in the AttributeConfiguration, allowing the
    AttributeProvider implementations to be singletons.

    Change path normalization config again, to use an enum.
    
    Add an option for Path objects to use the canonical form of names for determining
    equality rather than the display form. This allows Windows-like behavior of having
    Path objects use case-insensitive equality. All other platforms I've tried use the
    display form of the Path for equality.

    Rename FileSystemService to FileSystemView and FileSystemInitializer to JimfsFileSystems.
    
    More attempts to make the internal structure of the file system easier to understand.
    This change also removes a number of service fields from several classes, mainly
    FileSystemView.

    newAsynchronousFileChannel. It is specified to use "the default
    thread pool" in that case.

Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 2 17:56:57 2013 -0400

    Reorganize some internal classes.
    
    - Create FileTree, which replaces LookupService and should be the only thing that needs
      to know about the super root.
    - Change DirectoryTables to map Names to DirectoryEntry objects which contain a reference
      to the directory, the linked file and the name of the entry. FileTree's lookup method
      returns a DirectoryEntry rather than a LookupResult. LookupResult is removed.
    - Create FileFactory, which contains file creation code extracted from JimfsFileStore.
    - Re-create AttributeService, which contains attribute handling code extracted from
      JimfsFileStore.
    - JimfsFileStore now contains references to the FileTree, FileFactory, AttributeService
      and RegularFileStorage and provides public methods that delegate to those classes.
      That way it doesn't have too much code but it still provides a single API for doing
      file lookup, creation and attribute handling.

    Completely overhaul configuration API.
    
    File systems are now configured through a builder-like API.
    Attribute views can now be configured without touching AttributeProviders.
    File system storage can now be configured, including heap vs. direct,
    block size, etc.

    Change JimfsFileChannel to handle asynchronous interruption and close correctly.
    
    It should now match the contract of InterruptibleChannel, which FileChannel implements.
    Additionally, this allowed me to get rid of some ugly stuff in
    JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel that was there just to work around the fact that
    JimfsFileChannel wasn't properly interruptible.

    Change Disk/DiskByteStore to not zero blocks when freed.
    
    Blocks only need to be zeroed when a write starts at a position beyond the
    end of the file. This makes deletes *much* faster when using DiskByteStore.

    Add Disk, an abstract in-memory shared file storage, and DiskByteStore, a ByteStore backed by a Disk.
    
    Also add two implementations of Disk: SingleArrayDisk and MultiArrayDisk.
    SingleArrayDisk is backed by a single size-doubling array.
    MultiArrayDisk is backed by multiple fixed size arrays that are allocated as needed.
    
    FileContent now has a delete() method, to allow a DiskByteStore to free the blocks allocated to it
    for reuse by the Disk.

commit 8059005e0b48a482ea9631dc3f4bdd1013b3908b
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 18 18:46:51 2013 -0400

    Change DirectoryTable to map names to DirEntry objects containing Name and File.
    
    Since the name used to look up a file in a directory may differ from the actual
    name linking to that file, this makes it much faster to get the canonical name
    of the file and signficantly improves lookup speed, particularly when directories
    contain many entries.

    Change AbstractAttributeProvider to avoid string concatenation when getting/setting attributes in map.
    
    This actually produces fairly significant savings in the number of allocations and the number of bytes
    allocated when creating new files using AttributeProviders that set multiple initial attributes on the
    file.

    Fix an issue with lookups ending in "." or "..".
    
    The returned LookupResult contained "." or ".." as the file name and
    contained the wrong parent directory. This also accounts handles
    returning the correct name when the result is a root directory, as well
    as the correct parent for that directory (the super root file).

    Extract methods of File to an AttributeStore interface in jimfs.attribute.
    
    This provides a non-internal view of file attributes for use by AttributeProvider implementations.
    Convert all AttributeProvider-related code to use AttributeStore instead of File.

    Add support for viewing in-memory ZIP/JAR files as FileSystems using FileSystems.newFileSystem(Path, ClassLoader).
    
    This is done by creating a "jar:jimfs://..." URI for the path and then passing it off to be handled by the
    built in ZipFileSystemProvider. Works great as long as you just want to read the file; writing entries works
    but fails when it tries to sync the changes to the file system, as for some reason ZipFileSystem is
    hardwired to the default file system for that in a weird way.
    
    This change also slightly improves JimfsPath.toUri() to more or less work, but it still could use
    improvement.

    Simplify package structure some.
    
    Move classes in internal.file that aren't directly related to the
    abstraction of a file and its content to internal. Move classes in
    internal.bytestore to internal.file since there are only 2 classes
    and they represent regular file content.

    Change the base package from com.google.common.io.jimfs to com.google.jimfs.
    
    5 levels deep for the base package seemed like too much and was bugging me.
    Also shift all implementation to an internal package, leaving only user-facing
    APIs like the Jimfs class in the base package.

commit 45706baaefb007e5389fa6850ac083652508a808
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 3 14:24:51 2013 -0400

    File reads and writes now update file times.
    
    As part of this, ByteStoreFileChannel has been renamed to JimfsFileChannel and moved out of the bytestore package.
    It now stores the File as well as the ByteStore so it can update file times. ByteStoreInputStream and ByteStoreOutputStream
    have been removed in favor of just delegating to the FileChannel once again, for simplicity. ByteStore has been simplified
    to just have methods dealing with ByteBuffers once again.

commit 73a90272c96519763b25a294b857f5119bc8a017
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Sun Aug 18 13:48:00 2013 -0700

    Add a lot of new tests for the attribute package.
    
    Tests for all the core functionality such as AttributeService are in, plus tests for most of the
    individual AttributeProvider implementations. A few more AttributeProviders remain to be tested.

    Fix a test that was failing on Windows.
    
    The issue was just that the Files.write method that writes an Iterable
    of lines uses the platform default line separator. In this case, when
    the TRUNCATE option isn't used it overwrites one more character with the
    line separator than it does on \n platforms.

    Organize classes into packages once again.
    
    While it's nice being able to keep everything package-private, it's not worth how much
    harder it is to understand the code structure when it's all dumped in to one big package.

    Switch from using Strings for name elements in paths and directory entries to using Name objects.
    
    These allow for different case sensitivity settings by using a canonical form for equality while
    retaining the original string for display.
