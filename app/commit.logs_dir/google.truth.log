    Avoid MultimapBuilder, which is still @Beta.
    
    (I had been thinking like we could wait for 1.0 for this, but that feels like hurting people in the meantime for no good reason. And we should really set a good example. Credit to https://github.com/google/compile-testing/issues/125 for prompting me to do this now.)

    Deep copy withFailureMessage to withMessage and delegate to it.
    
    Following LSC CLs will migrate callers to 'withMessage' and ultimately the 'withFailureMessage' will be removed.
    
    Also removed one TODO of kak which seems obsolete (withFailureMessage already lives in AbstractVerb).

    Fix assertThat(Double.NaN).isNaN() in GWT/j2cl.
    
    In Java there is a difference between:
      Double.NaN == Double.NaN ==> False
    and:
      new Double(NaN).equals(Double.NaN) ==> true
    
    For performance reasons double is devirtualized in GWT/j2cl and thus making that difference is much much harder. Eventually this will be resolved with b/36792681, but right now truth does not work.
    
    This changes truths implementation do testing directly for NaN instead of relying on Object.equals for isNaN.
    Probably truth should run its tests in GWT/J2CL to catch such errors.

    Add space between types of Map.Entry in SubjectUtils.objectToTypeName().
    
    Reason: Type names are likely going to be long and separating them with only a comma is hard to read.
    
    Example:
    Map.Entry<com.google.very.long.package.name.SomeLongTypeName,com.google.very.long.package.name.SomeLongTypeName>
    vs
    Map.Entry<com.google.very.long.package.name.SomeLongTypeName, com.google.very.long.package.name.SomeLongTypeName>.

    MapSubjectTest.containsExactly_failsWithSameToString() now uses ExpectFailure.
    
    Note: The non-test changes are needed because ExpectFailure's FailureStrategy does not throw anything while the IterableSubject codebase assumes it will.

    IterableSubject now supports Map.Entry as type when toString() is equal so that MapSubject error messages are improved.

commit 53bebcb9535356c05140276bae9e81865d6503df
Author: diamondm <diamondm@google.com>
Date:   Mon May 15 10:12:24 2017 -0700

    Add ExpectFailure.expectFailureAbout(), a sibling to .expectFailure(), for
    asserting about custom subjects in Java 8 syntax. Need to introduce a
    separate "functional interface" as TestVerb and DelegatedVerb don't have a
    common parent type.
    
    Without this CL, users could already write something like:
    
      AssertionError expected =
          expectFailure(
              whenTesting ->
                  whenTesting.about(optionals()).that(Optional.of("foo")).isEmpty());
    
    But this is somewhat verbose to have to write in every test. Now they can instead write:
    
      AssertionError expected =
          expectFailureAbout(
              optionals(),
              whenTesting -> whenTesting.that(Optional.of("foo")).isEmpty());
    
    Or even pull out a small helper method, e.g.:
    
      private static AssertionError expectFailure(
          DelegatedAssertionCallback<OptionalSubject, Optional<?>> assertionCallback) {
        return expectFailureAbout(optionals(), assertionCallback);
      }
    
    Which will allow custom subject tests to simply write:
    
      AssertionError expected =
          expectFailure(whenTesting -> whenTesting.that(Optional.of("foo")).isEmpty());
    
    Just like native subject tests.

Date:   Fri May 12 09:30:42 2017 -0700

    Introduce a common mechanism for capturing failures in Truth, allowing SPI
    tests (such as Subject tests) to verify failures without needing to catch
    AssertionError or define their own custom FailureStrategy implementation.
    
    Migrates ThrowableSubject to use this mechanism, as an example, which also
    exposes a latent bug in the implementation.

    Bring the truth deps up to date
    
    Also, remove the "truth.version" property and explicit version setting in the extensions.  They should be relying on ${project.version} so as to ensure that when the project's version is updated, it inherits this value as the version of truth upon which it also depends.  This should avoid any future occasions where we publish a release version with a dependency on a truth SNAPSHOT version.

    Adding a containsCell and doesNotContainCell method that take a cell directly. Sometimes it's useful to have a helper generate the cell itself and pass that to the assertion than have 3 helpers for generating each part.
    
    Could maybe also call the methods contains() and doesNotContain() but I would be wary of "table-of-tables" situations.

    Make usingTolerance() and usingExactEquality() on PrimitiveDoubleArraySubject and PrimitiveFloatArraySubject obey named(), which they didn't previously. And make RelabeledSubjectsTest test this instead of testing the to-be-deprecated hasValuesWithin.
    
    (I note in passing that hasValuesWithin appeared to implement named() wrong because it replaces rather than prepends the array value. I don't plan to fix that for obvious reasons.)

    Undeprecate and implement the one-arg isEqualTo and isNotEqualTo on PrimitiveFloatArraySubject. This is to [] as double is to float.
    
    Also did a couple of javadoc fixes on the double side, as we weren't consistent between the one-arg and two-arg overloads (and the two-arg ones confusingly didn't mention the tolerance). Plus, it's no longer true that we deprecate some common methods, so remove that from the class-level docs.

    This is proposal 1 approved in API review []
    The implementation is copied from the other Primitive.*ArraySubjects.
    
    The javadoc is stolen from those and from DoubleSubject and for usingExactEquality for the boilerplate caveats.

Users shouldn't have to care about converting their primitive double array. This is necessary to allow us to deprecate hasValuesWithin smoothly (since that API took double...).

    Improve the error message we get from doing:
      assertThat(floatArray).usingExactEquality().contains(someDouble);
    
    The fact that this is now a runtime (well, test-time) failure rather than a compile-time failure is the one significant downside I can see from 4a1039f442e5e3bcd7b61aedcc8c93e589c7b9f2 I still think it's the right call[*], but let's make it as clear as possible to the user what's going wrong.
    
    Also fix a couple of places in which said "double" when they meant "float".
    
    [*] The alternatives are: make it back to a compile-time error, but we decided against that (the other things this change allows are useful); make it accept the double and cast to a float, but that silently loses precision on an "exact" assertion, and we decided against that; make it accept the double and cast the float to a double, but that is really weird, as it means that an assertion that { 0.1f } contains 0.1 fails (with an unhelpful failure message).

    Make assertThat(doubleArray).usingExactEquality accept expected values as Numbers as well as Doubles, with a runtime check on the type. Similarly for Floats.
    
    Note that we don't support any doubles in the float case, because it's too hard to figure out whether any given double has an exact float representation. And we don't support BigInteger or BigDecimal in either case. Although we could figure it out there, it wouldn't be simple, and there doesn't seem much point: users won't have these things by mistake; if they have them on purpose then they are presumably expecting to include values which are big and/or high-precision; and anyway the usage rates of these are very low.

    Remove MultimapSubject.UsingCorrespondence.valuesForKey.
    
    We did agree to do this in the API review, but on reflection I'm not sure whether it's a good idea. We already support
    
        assertThat(actual)
            .valuesForKey("me")
            .comparingElementsUsing(STRING_PARSES_TO_INTEGER_CORRESPONDENCE)
            .contains(456);
    
    and implementing this method would allow you to write
    
        assertThat(actual)
            .comparingValuesUsing(STRING_PARSES_TO_INTEGER_CORRESPONDENCE)
            .valuesForKey("me")
            .contains(456);
    
    which is equivalent. We think that having two ways of spelling the same thing is  unhelpful, because it risks creating confusion.
    
    Additionally, the former snippet (the one that already exists) allows you to call named() on the result of valuesForKey; the latter (which we'd get if we implemented this method) does not. It seems especially unhelpful if we say "there are two valid ways of doing this *unless* you want that named, in which case you have to pick the right one, which isn't exactly obvious".

    Use a newer JDK8 for travis build.
    
    (like https://github.com/google/guava/pull/2625 but for Truth)
    
    I'm hoping that this will fix compile failures like https://travis-ci.org/google/truth/jobs/191021196

    Implement MultimapSubject.UsingCorrespondence.containsExactlyEntriesIn.
    
    This CL makes it do all the correct assertions, and the failure messages seem okay to me... but the failure messages aren't as clever as those from MultimapSubject.UsingCorrespondence.containsExactlyEntriesIn. I raised b/34104379 to think about this. I think that this CL is worth getting in anyway.

    Slight simplification of MultimapSubject. The private two-arg containsExactly method was called from exactly one place an the failVerb argument was always a fixed string literal. So we might as well simplify things my inlining both the method and the argument.

    Hide AbstractArraySubject.
    
    Users already can't extend this (because its constructor is package-private), so I don't think we benefit from exposing the class.
    Hiding it might also tidy up the Javadoc: I'd expect for isEmpty, isNotEmpty, and hasLength to now show up as first-class members of PrimitiveDoubleArraySubject, etc., instead of as inherited. I mean, I guess we could argue that "inherited" is good because it pulls the common functionality out? But I don't think we want AbstractArraySubject to be more than an implementation details.

    Implement MapSubject.UsingTolerance.containsExactly and containsExactlyElementsIn.
    
    I didn't implement the no-arg containsExactly since they could just omit the comparingValuesUsing. (This follows the principle we've had of not supporting assertions in fuzzy truth where the fuzziness would have no effect.)
    
    I also had to make containsExactlyElementsIn generic, because with the wildcard signature the Map's entrySet() method just returns Set<?> (not even Set<Entry<?, ?>>). The alternative would be to leave the signature and do a hairy (but safe) cast.
    
    The implementation just delegates to IterableSubject. The failure messages aren't pretty, but I think they're clear enough. (The delegation is a little lazy, but no lazier than MapSubject itself.)

    Produce a gwt artifact for the Java 8 extensions.
    Colin's CL to open source Guava for Java 8 currently fails GWT tests because this GWT module isn't present.
    I had added internal GWT support (CL 133159853) but not external.

    Guava needs this version, but Maven is apparently happy to (sometimes) use the older version specified by Truth.
    This fixes the flakiness introduced by CL 137765885.

    Also adds tests for existing methods in the infinity/nan/-0.0 cases, which were missing before. (Since we separately expose this functionality through PDAS.usingTolerance and Correspondence.tolerance, we separately test it in both places, just to be sure.)

    NavigableSet in a followup; even if the user provides a Sorted* type we can let them make such assertions.

commit a9240a4c67890ab14b89f31b76f3920b9af34c26
Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 7 09:06:42 2016 -0700

    Add IterableSubject.ComparingElementsUsing.containsExactly. It just delegates to containsExactlyElementsIn.
    
    Note that it doesn't need to handle the "caller accidentally did containsExactly with a single Iterable argument when they meant containsExactlyElementsIn" test that the regular containsExactly does, because the generic type signature won't allow it. It does handle the null array case the same way.
    
    This CL includes a reduced set of tests, relative to the extensive set for containsExactlyElementsIn, which seems okay since it is a simple delegation. It does add tests with nulls for the existing contains and containsExactlyElementsIn methods.

    Fix a typo (I assume) in one of the failure messages from IterableSubject.containsExactly: it says "contains only" rather than "contains exactly".
    
    I've done a bit of random tidy-up while I was here. For one thing, the private method took a failVerb parameter which always had the same value, so I eliminated that. And that method is more similar to containExactlyElementsIn than it is to containsExactly, so I renamed it (which also means there's no confusion between the private two-arg overload the the public varargs overload).

    Add a paragraph to the javadoc for ProtoSubject to explain the value proposition a bit more clearly. In particular, I think the fact that you can get better error messages just by changing to this assertThat is worth pointing out.

    Un-generify ProtoSubject helpers and entry points, and tidy up the tests to match.
    
    Only subclasses will be able to specify an M that is not exactly Message or MessageLite (but we still want this so [] can inherit from the open source classes).
    
    (Also I made some docs changes because the truth_moe_docs target was broken.)

    Put the execution of the java8 extension into a profile, so that Travis can test it in java7 and java8 vms without breaking. In pre-1.8 vms the java8 extension will simply be ignored.
    
    This doesn't change -source/-target settings on any module, so if this is built on a java8 vm, it should produce code appropriate to 1.6 for core, and 1.8 for the java8 module.

    Renames `getSubject()` -> `actual()` and `getDisplaySubject()` -> `actualAsString()`
    
    Also adds `actualCustomStringRepresentation()` to let subjects themselves set a "displayable actual" rather than the unhappy practice of overriding the (formerly named) `getDisplaySubject()` which not only has a string representation of the content of the actual value, but has logic related to `.named()` and other contextual formatting.
    
    Preserves the old methods but deprecates them, to be cleaned up after.
    
    This would normally change semantics in a couple of cases where subjects were overriding getDisplaySubject() deliberately to alter the semantics of .named() to be a replacing operation rather than a prefixing one.  A temporary backwards compatibility is hacked in, but should be removed once a truly replacing "displayedAs()" method is added in a later commit.

    Finish implementing this API:
      assertThat(actualIterable).comparingElementsUsing(correspondence).containsExactlyElementsIn(expectedIterable);
    The heavy lifting here is done in an implementation of the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality bipartite matching in the GraphMatching helper class.
    
    There is a second, brute-force (exponentially slow) implementation of that matching problem in GraphMatchingTest which is used to validate the Hopcroft–Karp results.

    ProtoLiteSubject.protoLite() -> LiteProtoSubject.liteProtos()
    
    The point is to permit "about" to be meaningful on reading.  The factory is about the abstract conceptual "type" and it reads more consistently with english norms if it's plural.

    Fuzzy Truth: Start work on containsExactly functionality — this is the big fish in this pond. Specifically, this CL includes a partial implementation of IterableSubject.UsingCorrespondence.containsExactlyElementsIn. The other versions will hang off this. This CL handles some cases but the maximum cardinality bipartite matching algorithm is still unimplemented and so the method throws if it hits that bit. The method is package-visible, so that we can test it but don't expose it to users.

Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>

    Next steps in Fuzzy Truth.
    
    1. Add UsingCorrespondence.doesNotContain for iterables and doesNotContainEntry for maps and multimaps.
    
    2. Improve the grammatical correctness of failure messages.
    BEFORE: Correspondence.toString() was expected to be written for a plural subject (e.g. "are finite numbers within 0.00001 of") and this played badly with situations where the subject is singular — in particular, in maps where by definition there's only one value per key, and in particularly particular there was one failure message which would have read "but the value is <2.71828> which does not are finite numbers within 0.00001 <3.14159>". (I hadn't noticed this until now because it didn't show up in the example used in the tests.)
    AFTER: Correspondence.toString() was expected to be written for a singular subject (e.g. "is a finite number within 0.00001 of"). After spending ages playing with these things, I've concluded that it's easier to phrase the statements so that they always refer to a singular subject (if we have a collection we can refer to "each element") than that they always refer to a plural subject. (I don't really want to have two methods on Correspondence, one for each case, and require implementers to have to think about this grammar stuff.)
    
    3. Minor: Make the failure messages in the tests easier to understand by putting a + sign in front of each string-which-parses-as-an-integer, so that we can tell the difference between the string "+456" and the integer 456. (Although StringSubject quotes strings for display, IterableSubject et al do not. Perhaps they should: that's a separate question...)
    
    4. Very minor: Fix up some more which/that errors. I know this isn't really the end of the world, but once I'd started picking at it I kinda wanted to be consistent.

    Couple of small fixes for IterableSubject:
     - In the error message for UsingCorrespondence.contains(), say "elements that" instead of "elements which". It's a restrictive clause. (See e.g. http://www.getitwriteonline.com/archive/103103whichthat.htm for the grammar geekery.)
     - Clarify a couple of bits of javadoc which seems vague/confusing.

    Add the following APIs for Fuzzy Truth:
     - assertThat(actualMap).comparingValuesUsing(correspondence).containsEntry(key, value);
     - assertThat(actualMultiap).comparingValuesUsing(correspondence).containsEntry(key, value);
    and add private, unimplemented signatures for the remaining assertions.

    Fulfills a commitment in #202 to at least clarify the self-type, and relates to #250 in that the previous javadoc mirrors the old behavior (and intended behavior of displayedAs()).

    Add an "under construction" note to the javadoc of IterableSubject.UsingCorrespondence. In its current partial state, users are asking questions (e.g. []
    Add unimplemented private signatures for the missing methods, so that anyone looking should be able to see what we're planning (and so that we can review all the javadoc in one place).
    
    Add a few TODOs about some of the existing javadoc which I found unclear, and fix a couple of typos.
    
    Remove an unnecessary cast which had crept in.

commit 2b48cfb65c6735abe71d51912ad646ff1c9d13ba
Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 2 10:21:40 2016 -0700

    Fix four unchecked cast warnings in MapSubject and MultimapSubject. They seem easy enough to avoid, so we might as well.
    
    Two of them are trivial: Entry<?, ?> works just as well as Entry<Object, Object> and there is no need for the cast.
    
    In the other two, I'm converting multimap.get(key) to multimap.asMap().get(key) inside an if (multimap.containsKey(key)) condition, which is guaranteed to return the same thing, and again avoids the cast. The alternative would be to suppress the warning, since I think it's sort of implicitly safe by specification, but since we probably don't care about the possible performance cost of the asMap(), this seems neater. Happy to switch if you'd prefer.

    Add Correspondence.tolerance() and Primitive(Double|Float)ArraySubject.withTolerance.
    
    It is now possible to write both of these:
      assertThat(actualDoubleArray).withTolerance(1.0e-6).contains(1.23);
      assertThat(actualDoubleIterable).comparingElementsUsing(tolerance(1.0e-6)).contains(1.23);
    
    Also suppress a bunch of warnings where we're testing deprecated methods, since I'm here.

Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 26 10:54:10 2016 -0700

    Add a few missing test cases for (Double|Float)Subject.is(Not?)Within. The tolerance=0.0 case is something which seems worth testing since it's what we ask people who actually want exact equality to do. The infinite/NaN cases seem worth testing since we specifically call them out in the javadoc.

    Deprecate Primitive{Double|Float}ArraySubject.hasValuesNotWithin, and hide them internally (they have no usages except for their own tests and the other truth test modified here). Since we're going to get rid of them without offering an alternative as part of [] let's do that early so they don't pick up more users.
    
    In passing, update the TODOs on asList and add a couple of static keywords which klippy prompted me about.

    Have ThrowableSubject throw ComparisonFailures when possible.
    
    I'm not super happy with the message (see the test), but, given that
    ComparisonFailure will suffix the message with 'expected: <[foo]> actual: <[bar]>',
    i thought this was a reasonable tradeoff.

Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>

    Make the asList methods on Primitive(Double,Float)ArraySubject private. They were made public in [] although it's unrelated to the stated purpose of that CL. The comments explaining why they should be private are still there, and there are no unit tests for these methods, so I think having them public isn't really ideal. (We're discussing a proper way forwards on this.)
    
    There are exactly two usages in one file, who are also fixed in this CL.

Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 7 09:22:57 2016 -0800

    Make assertThat(doubleArray).hasValuesWithin(tolerance).of(expected) take double... instead of double[] for expected, and add .ofElementsIn(Iterable<? extends Number>). Similarly for float. While we're here, fix a couple of typos in text, and add tests for the case where the object (as well as the subject) are null.

    Fix a typo in Tolerant(Float|Double)Comparison's of method's javadoc. The expectation isn't specified earlier, it's specified here (assuming that this means the expected value). (There are a few things like the failure strategy and optionally the custom subject name and custom failure message which are also specified earlier, but it doesn't seem worth mentioning those here.)

      1. Slow jar building on ubuntu (fixed in 2.5)
      2. Out of date project metadata
      3. Make java8 builds not break on javadoc problems.
         - This is a mutually incompatible flag state between
           java7 and java8 flavors of javadoc, so we just
           conditionally disable it.

    As it stands, though, the current version doesn't work under Android or GWT, and it has more open bugs than Google users.

commit 9dc0712ff638f5ec16eeaa7b9c23a41b11c7053b
Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 16 08:59:43 2015 -0700

    Add isWithin(tolerance).of(expected) and isNotWithin(tolerance).of(expected) to PrimitiveDoubleArraySubject.
    
    Deprecate the existing isEqualTo(expected, tolerance) and isNotEqualTo(expected, tolerance) in favour of the new methods.
    
    While we're here, fully specify the behaviour of the newly deprecated methods, improve their test coverage (and consistency), and fix a bug in the error message of isEqualTo in the case where the lengths were unequal (it was using Arrays.asList(doubleArray) instead of Doubles.asList(doubleArray), which creates a list containing a single array rather than a list of doubles, and calling toString on it gives something unhelpful like [D@3eb738bb]). Oh, and fix a few trivial typos.

    Improve failure message when an |expected| char has been coerced to a long.
    (An |actual| char is already handled correctly because we call getDisplaySubject().)
    I feel a little bad about further increasing complexity, but I also don't feel certain enough about where we're going or confident enough in my knowledge of the system to want to risk "simplifying" it in a way that won't help in the long term.
    For example, arguably we could do something even better here, like convert "42" to a char or write "<*> (character code 42)."

    *** Original change description ***
    
    Fix int/long comparisons bug by adding:
    -IntegerSubject.isEqualTo(Long)
    -IntegerSubject.isNotEqualTo(Long)

    Work around a type inference change in javac
    
    The javac compiler's behavior when handling wildcards and "capture" type
    variables has been improved for conformance to the language specification. This
    improves type checking behavior in certain unusual circumstances. It is also a
    source-incompatible change: certain uses of wildcards that have compiled in the
    past may fail to compile because of a program's reliance on the javac bug.

commit 19acd4a844b85f433a9b55ccdc88f52c1ff7c117
Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 14 02:20:33 2015 -0700

    Changes to Truth's DoubleSubject's handling of non-finite values.
    
    The main behavioural changes is that an isNotWithin assertion now fails if either the subject or the object is either infinite. (Previously, it would pass if one argument was infinite and the other was finite, or if one argument was POSITIVE_INFINITY and the other argument was NEGATIVE_INFINITY. It already fails if either argument is NaN. An isWithin assertion already fails if either argument is either infinite or NaN.)
    
    This makes the corresponding change to MathUtil.notEquals(double, double, double). It also fixes MathUtil.notEquals(float, float, float) which had completely inverted the logic (it was untested, and luckily is also unused).
    
    Additionally, some of the error messages are improved.
    
    Also specify the existing and new behaviours in the javadoc, and add tests. And add tests for the non-special failing cases, since they seemed to be missing.

commit badd57168006147545916237f0085ab01ba595b8
Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Wed May 20 09:23:48 2015 -0700

    Make DoubleSubject's isWithin and isNotWithin fail if the tolerance is POSITIVE_INFINITY. Also simplify the failure message if the tolerance is NaN, because there's no point in including the "(NaN)" in "tolerance (NaN) cannot be NaN", and add a test for that case.
    
    This is item #3 in []
    
    TGP run, I think all the new failures are flakes: []

    Merge pull request #170 from cpovirk/gwt-java-8-compatibility
    
    Alternative approach to GWT-JDK8 compatibility.

commit a12ae963481ed649c4ca4712fd1407b76ac6b669
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 13:00:36 2015 -0500

    Tweaks to GWT compatibility:
    
    - The class exclusions for the source jar used the old org.truth0 names, so they were having no effect. I've updated them to point to com.google.common.truth.
    - ClassSubject was GWT-compatible even though neither its methods nor its that()/assertThat() access points were. I've made it fully @GwtIncompatible. The reason for partial GWT compatibility in the past seems to have been the potential to support the reflective declaresField method, which we have since removed. I base that conclusion on this old TODO: https://github.com/google/truth/blob/772f083c11f0bd0a917c1d7ded09e07305a441f2/core/src/main/java/com/google/common/truth/ClassSubject.java#L26

    Set sourcelevel to 1.7.
    
    This is similar to what we recently did for Guava: https://github.com/google/guava/commit/118ac49cddb47362b28cfd893f67791809d60679
    
    It's a way to get GWT working again with Java 1.8 without updating GWT to 2.7.0. The downsides of updating GWT are:
    - (completely speculative) Users might not have updated yet, and perhaps that's a problem somehow?
    - (not directly related to GWT but part of the same commit that I reverted) I'm seeing problems resolving AutoValue 1.0-SNAPSHOT. (I imagine that we could fix this by pushing a new version. Do we intend to have that set up to happen automatically with each successful build?)
    - For dependency reasons, we had to back out our workaround for slow group resolution. This is probably OK when we building with JDK8, but the problem still exists for anyone building with JDK7.
    - GWT now gets the wrong version of ASM, which makes our GWT tests fail. (We might be able to solve the dependency knot. I didn't investigate.) https://plus.google.com/106802216066771790262/posts/RbVEDY8QfKc?e=-RedirectToSandbox

Author: cpovirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 07:11:13 2015 -0800

    Allow us to check in a hardcoded open-souce .gwt.xml, which is necessary for inward MOE syncs to work. Then check in ones for Truth.
    
    Because the .gwt.xml files exist externally, MOE wants to sync them in. However, they didn't exist *internally* -- at least not in the repo, since they are generated files. This led MOE to believe that they were being added to the repo by external submissions.
    The fix is to actually add them to the repo internally. To ensure that they stay in sync with the internal versions, I've expanded our .gwt.xml-munging code to support verifying their contents against what the build system has been generating.
    
    The only change to truth_moe.tar as a result of this CL is some formatting changes to core/src/main/java/com/google/common/truth/Truth.gwt.xml. The formatting in those files has often seemed to change at random.... The file is otherwise unchanged, as expected, as is guava_moe.tar.

    Suffix "Did you mean to call containsExactlyElementsIn instead?" to calls to containsExactly(Object...) where there's just a single Iterable argument supplied.  This should help test writers when they accidentally call the wrong method by pointing out the method they probably want instead.

    Remove compiletesting tests for isOrdered/isPartiallyOrdered().  It breaks in
    Java8, isn't really testing truth, but rather javac's conformance to the java language spec.

    Not sure if this is the active Truth code, but I noticed that this method had an extra unreachable branch - it handles the case where the subject is a non-null string being compared to a non-null non-string twice.

Author: cgdecker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 14 10:54:46 2014 -0700

    Change containsAny(Of|In) to avoid potentially iterating the subject multiple times unless the subject is a Collection in which case it seems reasonable to assume that should be safe.
    
    While I'm at it, change the test names in IterableTest to use the word "contains" rather than "has".

    Rework the gwt build internally.
    
    From the perspective of the open-source version of Truth, this CL is a no-op aside from two things:
    - (the main one) c/g/c/truth/Truth.gwt.xml and org/truth0/Truth.gwt.xml both change to include the appropriate <inherits> lines, plus an unnecessary <exclude name="**/testing/**"/> that carries over from Guava.
    - GWT emulations move from gwtemul to super (to follow the internal build file convention). pom.xml is updated to match.

    Fix up ClassSubject and Subject to use a hierarchy search of getDeclaredField() instead of getField() which will throw NoSuchFieldException on private fields.  Also, setAccessible(true) on fields before using them, so (in a testing context without a security manager) the proposition for property access can do the right thing, even on a private field.
